# ThinkingMach Docs

Source for the [ThinkingMach](https://github.com/thinkingmach/paperclip) documentation site — user guides, API and CLI reference, adapter docs, and deployment notes.

**Read the docs:** https://docs.thinkingmach.com/

## What's inside

- **Guides** — Getting started, core concepts, and day-to-day usage.
- **API reference** — Control-plane endpoints and payload schemas.
- **CLI reference** — `paperclip` command surface.
- **Adapters** — Plugin authoring and the integrations catalogue.
- **Deploy** — Self-hosting, upgrades, and operational guidance.

The site is a single static shell that renders the Markdown files in `docs/` directly — no framework, no build step required to read the raw pages.

## Build and deployment

Build a release bundle locally with:

```sh
npm run docs:build
```
or
```sh
bun run docs:build
```

Cloudflare Pages is connected directly to `thinkingmach/paperclip-docs` through GitHub. There is no normal Wrangler publish step for this repo:

- Pushes to `main` deploy production at `https://docs.thinkingmach.com/`.
- Pushes to other branches create Cloudflare Pages preview/canary deployments.
- Canary URLs are created by Cloudflare for each deployment, for example `https://92b9a99c.paperclip-docs-74t.pages.dev`. Use the URL shown in the Cloudflare Pages deployment row or GitHub deployment/check for the pushed branch and commit.

That auto-deploy is not guaranteed — it has silently failed to fire on a push to `main` before. After anything reader-facing lands, check the live site rather than the merge, and republish by hand if it's stale:

```sh
npm run docs:build
npx wrangler pages deploy .site --project-name paperclip-docs --branch main
```

## Contributing

Spotted a typo, a broken link, or something that could be clearer? There are two easy paths, both linked from the footer of every docs page:

- **Suggest an edit** — opens the underlying Markdown file in GitHub's web editor. Make the change and submit a PR without leaving the browser.
- **Report an issue** — opens a prefilled [Docs feedback](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/03-docs-feedback.yml) issue with the page URL already attached.

For larger changes, fork the repo and open a PR against `main`. Screenshots live under `docs/user-guides/screenshots/{light,dark}/` and should be provided in both themes when replacing UI captures.
