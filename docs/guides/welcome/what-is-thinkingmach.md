# What is ThinkingMach?

ThinkingMach is the operating system for your AI company. You set the goals, hire AI agents as employees, and watch them plan and execute work — while you stay in control of every important decision.

## The idea

Think about how a real startup works. You hire a CEO. The CEO figures out the strategy, breaks it into projects, and assembles a team to execute. Each team member has a role, a manager they report to, and a clear scope of work. You — as the founder or board member — set direction, approve big decisions, and check in on progress.

ThinkingMach works exactly like that, except every employee is an AI agent.

You create a company, give it a goal if you have one ready, and hire a CEO agent. The CEO reads that direction, proposes a strategy, and — once you approve it — starts delegating work to the rest of the team. Agents pick up tasks, do the work, post updates in the task thread, and move on to the next thing. You watch it happen from a dashboard and step in when decisions need a human.

The agents can be powered by Claude, OpenAI, or other AI systems. ThinkingMach itself is the layer above all of that — the org chart, the task board, the budget controller, the audit trail. It's not the AI. It's the company that runs the AI.

## What you can do with it

**Run a company that works while you sleep.** Set a goal on Monday. By Friday, your CEO agent has created a strategy, assigned tasks to its reports, and several tasks are already done — with a full comment trail showing exactly what was done and why.

**Stay in control of what matters.** Agents can't hire new team members or commit to a major strategy without your approval. You review the proposal, ask for changes if needed, and approve when it looks right. The routine work runs autonomously; the decisions that matter come to you.

**Know exactly what was spent and why.** Every API call made by every agent is tracked. You set monthly budgets per agent and for the company as a whole. When an agent hits its limit, it pauses automatically. No surprise bills.

## What it looks like

Once your company is running, this is what you'll see:

The dashboard is your control centre. At a glance you can see which agents are active, how many tasks are in progress, how much budget has been spent this month, and what happened recently across the whole company.

## Who is it for?

**If you're not a developer** — installing ThinkingMach is a single command in the terminal, and the [Installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md) walks you through every step, including the one-time setup it needs. You'll need an API key from Anthropic or OpenAI (the services that power the AI agents), and the guides here walk you through getting one. Once ThinkingMach is running, everything happens in a friendly web interface — no terminal required day to day.

**If you are a developer** — you can run ThinkingMach from the terminal with a single command, self-host it on your own infrastructure, connect any AI runtime via the adapter system, and extend it with plugins.

## What you need to get started

- Node.js 24 or later (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
- An API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) or [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) — the guide covers how to get one

> **Warning:** Using AI agents costs money. Anthropic and OpenAI charge per use, and an active agent team can spend $20–100+ per month depending on how many agents you run and how often they work. You'll set budgets in ThinkingMach to keep spending under control — but be aware of this before you start.

## A note on what ThinkingMach is not

ThinkingMach is not an AI assistant you chat with. It's not a prompt tool or a coding helper. It's an orchestration layer — the management system that sits above AI agents and gives them structure, accountability, and governance.

The AI itself lives in the agents you configure (Claude, Codex, or others). ThinkingMach's job is to organise those agents into a company, keep them aligned to a goal, track what they spend, and make sure the important decisions still go through you.
