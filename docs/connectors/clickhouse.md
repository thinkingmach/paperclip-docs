# ClickHouse

Agents can query a ClickHouse Cloud ClickStack service — useful for letting an agent answer questions from observability or analytics data.

> **Warning:** This is ClickHouse Cloud's managed ClickStack server. A self-hosted or self-managed ClickHouse cluster is not reachable through this connector. If you run your own ClickHouse, [connect your own MCP server](custom-mcp-servers.md) instead.

## Before you connect

- A ClickHouse Cloud account with a ClickStack service.
- The **ClickHouse Cloud service ID** for that service. Copy it from **ClickStack → Team Settings → API & Agents**. It looks like `11e1031f-9a13-4cac-9bc7-d4ec9286ec17`.
- Database grants on the account you sign in with. What an agent can query is decided by ClickHouse's own users and grants, so decide those before connecting rather than after.

## Connect ClickHouse

1. Open **Connectors** and select **ClickHouse**.
2. On the **Access** step, choose the identity and which agents may use the connection.
3. Select **Sign in with ClickHouse** and complete browser sign-in.
4. Enter the **ClickHouse Cloud service ID**.
5. Finish setup.

## Choose access

The real control is on the ClickHouse side. Reach is whatever the signed-in account's database users and grants permit — ThinkingMach does not add a table or database filter on top.

If an agent should only read, grant only read. A read-only ClickHouse user is a stronger and clearer boundary than relying on action settings alone, and it survives changes to the tool catalog.

> **Warning:** ClickHouse queries can be expensive. A poorly bounded query over a large table costs real compute and can affect the service for everyone using it. Keep agent queries bounded, and prefer a service or user with sensible quotas.

Any schema-changing or data-changing operations should stay **Off** unless you have a specific reason. See [Set action permissions](action-permissions.md).

### `LIMIT` is not a cost control

This is the trap worth internalising before you let an agent near a large table. `LIMIT` caps the rows a query *returns*. It does not reliably bound the rows it *reads* to produce them — a `LIMIT 10` over an unfiltered table can still scan the whole table.

ClickHouse says so directly in its guidance for agent-generated queries: "ALWAYS bound scan size with `max_rows_to_read` or `max_bytes_to_read` — `LIMIT` alone does not prevent a full scan."

Bound the work itself, on the ClickHouse side, with settings such as:

| Setting | What it bounds |
| --- | --- |
| `max_rows_to_read` | Rows scanned before materialization — the guardrail that actually holds |
| `max_bytes_to_read` | Bytes scanned |
| `max_execution_time` | Interrupts a query exceeding N seconds |
| `max_estimated_execution_time` | Rejects a query whose projected runtime is too long |

Set these as quotas or profile settings on the ClickHouse user the connection signs in as, so they apply to whatever an agent writes rather than depending on the agent remembering. ClickHouse's [agent query-safety guidance](https://github.com/ClickHouse/agent-skills/blob/main/skills/clickhouse-best-practices/rules/agent-query-safety.md) has the recommended values.

## Try it

Verify with **metadata only**. A metadata read confirms the credential and the grants without scanning table data at all, which avoids a query against application table contents but still uses provider requests and resources:

```txt
List the databases and tables the ClickHouse connection can see. Do not query
any table contents and do not change anything.
```

Expect a list matching what you see in ClickStack for that user's grants.

Only once that works, and only against a table you know is small, try a bounded read — and rely on the user's scan limits rather than a `LIMIT` clause to keep it bounded.

Do not verify with a count over a production table. "The smallest table" is not a sufficient cost limit: the agent may run additional queries to identify it.

> **Note:** Illustrative task, not a recorded test result. No query was executed against any ClickHouse service for this documentation.

## Troubleshooting and limitations

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup will not complete | The service ID is missing or malformed | Copy it from **ClickStack → Team Settings → API & Agents** |
| You cannot find a service ID | The account has no ClickStack service, or it is self-hosted | ClickStack on ClickHouse Cloud is required |
| Authorization succeeds but no tables appear | The signed-in user has no grants on any database | Grant access to the user in ClickHouse |
| Some tables are missing | Grants cover only some databases | Adjust the grants; no reconnect needed |
| A query is refused | The user is read-only and the query writes | Expected if you configured it that way |
| A query is slow or expensive despite a `LIMIT` | `LIMIT` bounds returned rows, not rows scanned | Set `max_rows_to_read` / `max_bytes_to_read` and an execution-time limit on the ClickHouse user |
| **Needs attention** | The sign-in expired or the service was removed | Select **Reconnect** and confirm the service still exists |

Limitations: one ClickStack service per connection. ClickHouse Cloud only. Access control is ClickHouse's grants, not a ThinkingMach resource filter.
