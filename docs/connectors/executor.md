# Executor

Executor puts one endpoint in front of configured integrations. ThinkingMach connects to that endpoint; Executor handles the upstream connections and its own policies.

Executor is available on every instance; no experimental setting is required.

## Before you connect

- An Executor deployment with the integrations and connections you intend to expose.
- A reachable remote endpoint URL and its required authentication details.

Use the URL for your deployment. ThinkingMach's connector definition does not supply a default server URL.

## Connect Executor

> **Unverified setup:** This procedure follows the pinned ThinkingMach definition and Executor's MCP Proxy documentation. It has not been tested with a live Executor connection. Each step below is unverified.

1. **Unverified:** Configure the intended integrations, credentials, and policies in Executor. Obtain the remote endpoint URL for that deployment.
2. **Unverified:** Open **Connectors** and select **Executor**.
3. **Unverified:** Read the access line above the main button. Select **Change** to choose the identity or narrow the agents that may use it.
4. **Unverified:** Paste the endpoint URL. Sign in if required, or add a token or headers under **Authentication** after selecting **Change** according to your deployment's instructions.
5. **Unverified:** Select **Connect Executor** and inspect the exposed action list.

A local command such as `executor mcp` is not a remote URL. Use [Connect a custom MCP server](custom-mcp-servers.md) for the distinction between remote connectors and adapter-level local processes.

## Choose access

Tools come from your Executor account and appear in ThinkingMach when you connect. The reachable integrations depend on Executor's configuration.

Every tool starts as **Allowed**. Set exposed actions to **Ask first** or **Off** on **Permissions** as needed. Executor's upstream policies are another layer; a ThinkingMach approval does not override an Executor denial. If an exposed action bundles several upstream operations, ThinkingMach governs that call rather than each internal operation.

## Try it

Ask an eligible agent to perform one read-only lookup from an integration you configured. Compare the result with the source system and inspect the connector call.

> **Unverified check:** Suggested test, not a recorded result. Use an action visible in your connection and avoid changes to upstream systems.

## Troubleshooting and limitations

| Problem | Check |
| --- | --- |
| The endpoint cannot be reached | Check deployment availability and whether ThinkingMach can reach the supplied URL. |
| Sign-in or headers fail | Use the authentication settings for that deployment. |
| An integration is missing | Check its configuration and connection in Executor, then **Refresh actions** in ThinkingMach. |
| A call is refused | Inspect both ThinkingMach permissions and Executor's upstream policies. |

Executor deployment versions can expose different interfaces. This page does not promise a fixed tool list or compatibility with every deployment version.
