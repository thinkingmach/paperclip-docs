# OpenRouter

An OpenRouter connection gives agents a credential that routes to many model providers through one account. It is model access, not a set of tools — there are no actions to permit.

OpenRouter is API key only. There is no subscription sign-in for this provider, and ThinkingMach says so on the sign-in screen.

## Before you connect

- An OpenRouter account with credit or billing set up, and an API key from [OpenRouter keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
- An agent that runs on the OpenCode runtime. This credential is only usable by an agent whose harness resolves to OpenCode.
- A model id that starts with `openrouter/`. This is a hard requirement, not a convention — ThinkingMach treats an OpenRouter connection as incompatible with a model id that lacks the prefix.

## Connect OpenRouter

1. Open **Connectors** and select **OpenRouter**.
2. On the **Access** step, choose whether the credential is **Personal** or **Company shared**, and which agents may use it.
3. Paste the API key. ThinkingMach stores it as a secret and it is not readable afterwards.

## Assign the credential

- **Set it as your default** for the provider, and agents configured to use the responsible user's connection draw on each person's own account.
- **Bind a specific shared connection** to the agent so eligible runs use that account.

A specific binding is not unconditional. Each run through it must satisfy all three, or be refused:

| Requirement | Why a run fails without it |
| --- | --- |
| The connection is **Company shared** | A specific binding must point at a company-shared account; the older personal-account binding is a legacy format the current interface no longer creates |
| The run has a **responsible user** who may use the credential | The human sharing audience governs every binding — *"This credential is not shared with the responsible user"* |
| The connection is **installed for that agent** (or company-wide) | Otherwise *"This connection is not permitted for this agent"* |

A binding **cannot substitute for a responsible user**: with nobody responsible there is nobody for the check to evaluate.

Then set the agent's model to an `openrouter/`-prefixed id, for example `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`. The provider and model choice happens in the agent's configuration; the connection only supplies the credential.

> **Warning:** Authenticating successfully does not mean a particular model is available to you. OpenRouter decides which upstream models your account can route to, based on its own availability, your credit, and any provider-specific requirements. A key that works for one model can be refused for another.

## Try it

```txt
Reply with the single word: ready
```

Run it on an agent with an `openrouter/`-prefixed model, after noting which AI connection that agent is configured to use.

**A reply proves** an OpenRouter credential was accepted, the runtime and model prefix are compatible, and the checks above passed — ThinkingMach refuses an ineligible binding rather than falling back to another account. **It does not prove which OpenRouter account was charged**; ThinkingMach does not surface that attribution per run, so check the activity and credit balance in your OpenRouter account if you need to confirm it.

If it fails, change only one thing at a time — the model id is the most common cause.

> **Note:** Illustrative task, not a recorded test result.

## Troubleshooting and limitations

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *"Select an AI connection compatible with this harness and model"* | The model id does not start with `openrouter/`, or the agent is not on an OpenCode runtime | Fix the model id, or move the agent to an OpenCode runtime |
| There is no subscription option | Expected. OpenRouter is API key only | Use an API key |
| *"Connect an account and choose your personal default"* | The agent uses the responsible user's connection and that person has no default | Connect an account and mark it as your default |
| *"This run needs a responsible user to select an AI connection"* | The run has no responsible person to evaluate the credential checks against | Give the work an eligible responsible user. Binding a shared connection does **not** work around this |
| The key works but one model is refused | OpenRouter is not routing that model for your account | Choose another model, or check the model's requirements with OpenRouter |
| Runs fail once usage rises | OpenRouter credit is exhausted or a rate limit applied | Top up or check limits in your OpenRouter account |
| Status **needs attention** | The key was revoked or rotated | Reconnect with a current key |

Limitations: one connection is one OpenRouter account, and it grants no tool access. Only `openrouter/`-prefixed models are usable with it. Which upstream models are reachable is OpenRouter's decision, not ThinkingMach's.
