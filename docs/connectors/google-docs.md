# Google Docs

> **Warning:** **Google verification pending.** ThinkingMach has not yet completed Google app verification. You may see an unverified-app warning during authorization. If Google offers an **Advanced** option to continue to ThinkingMach, you can choose to proceed after reviewing the requested access. This option is not available for every account; Workspace administrator restrictions and other Google access requirements still apply. Contact [support@thinkingmach.com](mailto:support@thinkingmach.com) if you cannot connect.

Agents can read the text and structure of Google Docs documents, and on an editing connection update them.

> **Warning:** Google Docs needs Google Workspace Developer Preview registration before it will authorize. Google must register the Workspace email that signs in, and the Cloud project that owns the OAuth client if you bring your own. Apply first at [Google Workspace Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview).

## Before you connect

- A Google Workspace account that can already open the documents you want agents to use.
- Developer Preview registration for that account, confirmed by Google.
- Without ThinkingMach Cloud enrollment, you need your own Google OAuth client with the **Drive API**, **Docs API**, and **Docs MCP API** enabled. [Set up your own Google OAuth app](google-setup.md) is the complete procedure — do it before you start here.

## Pick a capability group

| Group | What agents can do | Scopes requested |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Read only** | Read document text and structure | `drive.readonly`, `documents.readonly` |
| **Read & edit** | The above, plus update a document | `drive.readonly`, `drive.file`, `documents` |

The group is fixed for the life of the connection.

## Connect Google Docs

1. Open **Connectors** and select **Google Docs**.
2. On the **Access** step, choose the identity and which agents may use the connection.
3. Choose the capability group, then **Connect with ThinkingMach** or **Use your own Google OAuth app** — the latter needs the client ID and secret from [Set up your own Google OAuth app](google-setup.md).
4. Complete Google's consent screen with the registered Workspace account.

## Choose access

Document reach comes from Google: the connection can open what the authorizing account can open. There is no document picker in ThinkingMach.

Reviewed operations:

| Operation | Group |
| --- | --- |
| `read-doc` | Both |
| `update-doc` | **Read & edit** only |

This is a deliberately small surface: two operations, not a Docs editor. `update-doc` applies changes through the Docs API, so what it can express is whatever that API accepts — check the operation's schema on the **Permissions** tab before planning work that depends on a particular kind of edit. What is definitely absent is anything beyond these two operations: there is no separate tool here for comments, suggestions, or revision history.

> **Note:** The connector's guidance is that document updates should be approved. Leave `update-doc` on **Ask first**; an edit lands in a real document that other people may be working in.

[How connector access works](access-model.md) covers identity and agent selection.

## Try it

Identify the document by its URL, not its title, and pick something in it you already know. Substitute both:

```txt
Read this Google Doc — https://docs.google.com/document/d/YOUR_DOC_ID/edit — and
tell me the text of its first heading. Do not edit it.
```

Expect the heading you can see for yourself.

> **Warning:** Do not test with "the document titled X". The reviewed operation here is `read-doc`, which takes a document identifier — there is no document-search tool on this connector. A title-based request makes the agent guess or fail for reasons that have nothing to do with your setup. If you genuinely need title search, that is [Google Drive](google-drive.md) or [Google Workspace Search](google-workspace-search.md).

If you want to confirm editing, do it on a scratch document you created for the purpose, not a live one.

> **Note:** Illustrative task, not a recorded test result. Substitute a document URL or ID you can open and a value you already know.

## Troubleshooting and limitations

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Google refuses before the consent screen | Developer Preview registration is incomplete | Finish registration and retry |
| **Connect with ThinkingMach** is not offered | The instance is not enrolled with ThinkingMach Cloud, or Cloud is not advertising the Docs profile | Use your own Google OAuth app |
| A document cannot be found | It is not shared with the authorizing account | Share it in Google Drive; no reconnect needed |
| `update-doc` is missing | The connection was made with **Read only** | Make a connection with **Read & edit** |
| An edit did not produce the formatting you expected | The update goes through the Docs API, which does not cover every editor feature | Finish the formatting in Google Docs |
| **Needs attention** | The Google token expired or was revoked | Select **Reconnect** |

Limitations: one connection covers one Google account. Creating a document is not part of this connector — use [Google Drive](google-drive.md) with the create group. Comments, suggestions, and revision history are not exposed. Developer Preview applies.
