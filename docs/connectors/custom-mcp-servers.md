seo_title: Connect a Custom MCP Server
seo_description: Add an MCP server that is not in the ThinkingMach catalog by URL, by pasting a config, or with a provider-generated URL, and govern it like any connector.

# Connect a custom MCP server

The catalog covers the providers ThinkingMach has reviewed. For anything else — a server you run, a provider that is not listed, or a URL a provider generated for you — there are three entry points on the **Connectors** page.

## Connect your own MCP server

*"Enter the URL for a custom or self-hosted MCP server."*

Select **Connect your own MCP server**, paste the full `http` or `https` address, and let ThinkingMach work out what the server needs: *"ThinkingMach asks the server what it needs and walks you through it. Start here."*

What happens next depends on the server:

- **It advertises OAuth.** ThinkingMach registers a client and takes you through browser sign-in. If the authorization server supports neither Client ID Metadata Documents nor dynamic registration, ThinkingMach stops and asks you for a client you registered yourself rather than losing the draft connection.
- **It wants a key.** ThinkingMach asks for it, and states where it goes: *"ThinkingMach sends your key as an Authorization header."* Custom headers are available for servers that expect something else.
- **It wants nothing.** ThinkingMach says so plainly: *"The server is open to anyone with the address."* Treat that address as the credential.

A server outside the reviewed catalog is labelled **Unverified server**. That label is a statement about review, not about whether the connection works.

## Paste a config

*"Paste an existing setup snippet and connect it."*

If you already have a working MCP client configuration — from another tool, a provider's quickstart, a teammate — **Paste a config** reads the server URL and credential shape out of it instead of making you retype them. ThinkingMach validates the result before saving.

## Paste a provider-generated URL

Some providers hand you a single URL with the token already embedded. Zapier is the catalog entry for this shape: *"Paste the complete MCP URL Zapier gives you, including its token."*

The URL is a secret. Anyone holding it holds the access. ThinkingMach stores it as one, and the connection's action permissions apply the same way they do to any other connector.

## The two generic definitions behind this

ThinkingMach has two catalog entries that exist to back the generic paths rather than to be browsed:

| Definition | Slug | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **OAuth app** | `oauth-generic` | *"Connect a provider using your own OAuth client."* You supply a client ID and client secret; dynamic registration is used when the provider supports it. |
| **API key app** | `api-key-generic` | *"Connect an API using a key from your provider."* You supply a key, which ThinkingMach presents on each call. |

Neither appears in the **Connectors** list. They are reached through the generic entry points above.

## Governance is identical

A custom server is not a lesser citizen. The same four gates apply: the connection, the identity, agent access, and per-action permission. The action list is read from the server you pointed at, classified read, write, or destructive, and each entry set to **Allowed**, **Ask first**, or **Off**.

Because the server has not been reviewed, two habits are worth keeping:

- Start with every write **Off** and promote deliberately. A name-based classification is the fallback when a server publishes no annotations, and an unfamiliar naming scheme can under-classify.
- Re-run **Refresh actions** after you change the server, then review the list. On a pasted-URL connection a newly discovered action becomes active under the policies already in force — it is not held back for approval — so a refresh can widen what agents can call.

## Not the same as an adapter MCP server

Attaching an MCP server to an agent's *runtime* — through the adapter's own configuration — is a different mechanism with different governance. ThinkingMach's action permissions and review queue do not sit in front of it. See [Add an MCP server to an agent](../how-to/add-mcp-server-to-agent.md) for that path, and pick it deliberately rather than by accident.
