# Answer a connector review request

When an agent calls an action set to **Ask first**, the call stops and waits for a person. This is where you answer it.

## Find the waiting requests

Two places, same queue:

- **Connectors → Review**, for everything across the company.
- A connector's own **Review** tab, scoped to that one connection.

Pending items are labelled **Waiting for your OK**. The connector list flags the connection as **Needs attention** while something is pending.

The API equivalent is:

```http
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/action-requests?status=pending
```

## What a request shows you

Review the action, connection, and request details shown in the card. The available details depend on the request type. If the preview does not establish what will change, inspect the task and ask the agent to clarify before approving.

## The three answers

| Answer | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| **Allow once** | Approves this stored call without creating a rule for future calls. A new call still needs approval unless another policy permits it. |
| **Always allow** | Approves this call and lets the same agent use the same action with **different arguments** on this connection, within the current project when present. Offered only for eligible requests. |
| **Decline** | Rejects this request without running its action. The agent must change approach. |

Choose **Allow once** when you only intend to approve the specific request in front of you. **Always allow** is broader than remembering an identical set of arguments.

## Trust rules

A trust rule is a stored company tool policy created from one approval. It is not invisible: rules are listed under the company's tool policies with the selectors they match, and each one can be revoked.

Revoking a trust rule removes that allowance. Future calls are evaluated against the remaining policies, including **Ask first** where configured. It does not undo calls that already ran.

Prefer **Allow once** until you are comfortable authorizing that action with other arguments in the stated scope. A successful read or one harmless write does not establish that every later use is acceptable.

## What the agent experiences

An agent calling an Ask-first action does not get an error and does not get a result — it gets told approval is required, and it waits. ThinkingMach wakes the agent again when you answer.

Approval means approve and run: ThinkingMach attempts the stored call using its saved arguments. Approval is not proof that the provider operation succeeded; check the execution result. An agent should not re-issue the call after an approval; if the wake says it executed, that result is the result.

A declined request means the action did not happen. The agent is expected to change approach rather than retry the same call.

Pending requests expire. After expiry the item reads **Expired — send it again**, and the agent has to make a fresh call to open a new request.

## If a request seems stuck

- **Denied — see Review for why** on a test call means the request was declined, not that the connector is broken.
- A request that never appears usually means the call never reached the gateway. Check the action is not **Off**, and that the agent is in the connection's allowed set.
- A connection in **Paused** state does not produce review requests, because agents cannot use it at all.
