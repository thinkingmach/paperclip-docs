# GitHub

GitHub supports repository tools and an experimental chat/review bot in ThinkingMach. Choose the setup for the work you want to do.

## Which do you want?

| If you want | Set up | What it gives you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agents to read and act on repositories as part of their own work | **Use this connection as an agent tool** | GitHub actions an agent can call, and for a managed identity the credential the run's shell uses |
| People to start work from GitHub, or an agent to review PRs | **Chat with an agent** | A bot App assigned to one agent, with task-bound review tools and PR checks when enabled |

A personal GitHub connection does not create a bot App. Use [GitHub connector setup](github-setup.md) for regular repository tools, or [Set up a GitHub review bot](github-review-bot-setup.md) for the experimental chat journey. Read [Understanding GitHub PR review bots](understanding-github-review-bots.md) to distinguish installation, triggers, and merge requirements.

Before you give an agent a GitHub identity, read the shell exception — it is the boundary most often misread.

## The shell exception

ThinkingMach's per-action **Allowed** / **Ask first** / **Off** switches govern tool calls that go through ThinkingMach's tool gateway. When a GitHub connection is bound to an agent as a dedicated identity, that same identity is also handed to the agent's workspace shell, and shell commands do not go through the gateway.

ThinkingMach states this when you change a GitHub permission:

> **Danger:** Shell Git and `gh` use this account for the run and are not constrained by per-tool Ask-first controls.

Three things this does **not** mean:

- **It is not a claim about other connectors, in either direction.** This warning is about shell Git and `gh` on this connection. It says nothing about how any other connector behaves, and you should not read it as a promise that everything else is confined to the gateway — model-provider connections supply a credential rather than making tool calls at all, and messaging channels carry conversation over their own transport. [How connector access works](access-model.md) sets out which controls apply to which kind of connection.
- **It is not a claim that the agent is unrestricted.** The ceiling is whatever the GitHub account can do: the repositories selected on the installation, and that account's permissions on them. Narrow the account, not the switches.
- **Human approval is not code review.** An approved **Ask first** call means a person said yes to one API call. A pull request review is a separate control, on GitHub, done by a reviewer. Neither substitutes for the other.

The practical consequence: for an agent that will push code, the limits that matter are GitHub-side — selected repositories, branch protection, required reviews — not ThinkingMach's per-tool switches.

## GitHub as an agent tool

### Choose a credential

| Path | When to use it | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Use this connection as an agent tool** | The default. ThinkingMach manages the GitHub App authorization, and the identity is also available to shell Git and `gh` | Only when the instance is enrolled with ThinkingMach Cloud and Cloud advertises the GitHub connector profile |
| **Personal access token (advanced)** | No Cloud enrollment, or you want a token you control directly | Always |

The two are not equivalent. A fine-grained personal access token carries the permissions you select on the token. The managed path's permissions come from the GitHub App registration and the repositories chosen on the installation — GitHub returns no OAuth scope list for it, so there is no scope string to inspect. If you need to reason precisely about permissions, a fine-grained token is easier to audit; if you need a durable identity for shell work, the managed path is the one that provides it.

### Choose an identity

The managed path offers personal or dedicated-agent access. Its definition does not offer an organization-shared grant:

| Setup choice | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **My GitHub account** | *"Every agent may use your GitHub when you're responsible."* Choose **Only agents I choose** to narrow it |
| **A dedicated account for an agent** | *"That agent always uses this account, regardless of who starts the run."* Commits and comments are attributable to the agent |

A dedicated agent identity is the right choice when you want agent commits distinguishable from a person's. Creating one is a manager operation: *"Only connection managers can authorize a dedicated agent identity."*

### Repository access

For the managed GitHub App path, repository scope is set in GitHub. The connection's identity card reflects the installation:

- **Accessible GitHub repositories** lists the selected repositories, or shows **All current and future repositories** for an org-wide installation.
- **Add More Repos on GitHub** and **Configure access on GitHub** link into GitHub's installation settings.
- **Refresh access** re-reads the installation after you change it there.

Prefer selected repositories for the managed App. An installation granting all current and future repositories widens as the organization grows.

For a personal access token, review the token's resource owner, selected repositories, permissions, expiry, and any organization approval in GitHub. GitHub App installation controls do not set a PAT's scope.

### Actions

GitHub's hosted server supplies the action list, so ThinkingMach does not ship a frozen copy. Read the live list on the connection's **Permissions** tab and use **Refresh actions** after GitHub changes it.

What happens to an action GitHub adds depends on which credential path you took. On the **managed** path new and changed actions are held back until you turn them on. On a **personal access token** connection they become active under the policies already in force — so review the list after a refresh rather than assuming it can only narrow. [Set action permissions](action-permissions.md) has the full rule.

Actions are classified read, write, or destructive and can be set **Allowed**, **Ask first**, or **Off** — remembering what those settings do and do not bound. See [Set action permissions](action-permissions.md).

### Try it

Use a read against a repository you expect the selected credential to reach:

```txt
Read the README in YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO and report its first heading. Do not change anything.
```

Compare the heading with the repository and inspect the task's connector call. For managed access, also check the GitHub App installation's selected repositories; for a PAT, check the token's repository selection and permissions. One successful read does not prove the credential cannot reach other repositories. Do not verify with a push, pull request, or merge.

> **Note:** Illustrative task, not a recorded test result.

## GitHub as a channel

People comment in an issue or pull request, mentioning the agent, and ThinkingMach creates a task.

### Before you connect

- **Chat connectors** must be switched on for the instance. It is an experimental setting, off by default, enabled by an instance administrator under experimental settings.
- Permission to create a GitHub App in the organization, and to install it.
- The agent that will answer.

### Set up the bot

[Set up a GitHub review bot](github-review-bot-setup.md) walks through the
experimental setup with a Storybook example: choose the agent, register an App
from a manifest (or connect an existing one), install it, enable repositories,
verify tools, link your account, and configure behavior.

The bot can receive its own App's governed GitHub tools through **Assign this
bot’s GitHub tools**. Verify the assigned agent's effective access; a working
webhook alone does not prove tool access. Your personal connection links your
identity and does not replace the bot's App credentials. Workspace shell Git
access is configured separately.

### Access

Provider channel or repository access determines where a message can reach the integration; it does not by itself authorize agent work. ThinkingMach also checks the sender's linked identity and company membership. Linked users must be active non-viewer members. Unlinked senders depend on the connection's **Allow unlinked people** setting and any sponsor requirements. Review these controls before inviting people to use the agent.

### Try it

1. In a repository where the App is installed, open a scratch issue.
2. Comment, mentioning the agent, and ask it to confirm it is connected.
3. Expect a reply comment and a matching task in ThinkingMach.

> **Note:** Procedure, not a recorded test result. Use a scratch repository or issue.

## Not the same as the workspace git setup

[Connect an agent to a GitHub repo](../how-to/connect-agent-to-github.md) is a different job: pointing a project workspace at a remote, and matching ThinkingMach's review stage to GitHub's. That page remains the right one for the git and `gh` workflow itself. This connector is how the credential gets there. Use both.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Use this connection as an agent tool** is not offered | The instance is not enrolled with ThinkingMach Cloud, or Cloud is not advertising the GitHub profile | Use **Personal access token (advanced)** |
| **Chat with an agent** is not offered | **Chat connectors** is off for the instance | Ask an administrator to enable it |
| The agent sees fewer repositories than expected | The installation does not include them | **Add More Repos on GitHub**, then **Refresh access** |
| *"You don't have permission to reconnect this identity."* | The identity belongs to another person or agent | Ask its owner, or use your own |
| Tool calls succeed but shell `git push` fails | The account's repository permissions, or branch protection | Check both on GitHub |
| Comments do not create tasks | The App is not installed on that repository, or the events are not selected | Install it there and confirm the two comment events |
| Webhook deliveries fail in GitHub | The webhook secret or URL does not match | Regenerate the secret in ThinkingMach and update the App |
| **Needs attention** | The token expired or the installation was removed | Select **Reconnect** |

## Limitations

The managed repository-tool path depends on Cloud enrollment. The chat/review-bot path depends on the experimental chat setting and uses its own App. Both require appropriate GitHub repository access; review bots also have an enabled-repository subset in ThinkingMach. ThinkingMach cannot constrain shell Git or `gh` with per-action settings.
