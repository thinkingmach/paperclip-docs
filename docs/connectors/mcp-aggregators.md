# Connect apps through an MCP aggregator

Some apps have no connector of their own in ThinkingMach. An **MCP aggregator** fills that gap: it is an outside service that connects to many apps on your behalf and hands them to ThinkingMach through one MCP server. ThinkingMach supports four of them — **Arcade**, **Composio**, **Executor**, and **Zapier** — each with its own entry on the **Connectors** page.

Keep one thing in mind throughout: the aggregator sits between your agent and the app. It holds the app sign-ins and carries the requests. ThinkingMach still decides which people and agents can use the connection and which of its tools they may call, but anything the aggregator does inside the app is governed on the aggregator's side.

## Turn them on first

MCP aggregators are experimental. All four stay hidden from **Connectors** until an instance administrator turns on **MCP aggregators** in the instance's experimental settings, which is off by default. While the setting is off, ThinkingMach also refuses new setup, reconnect, and sign-in requests for these providers. Turning it off later hides setup only; connections you already have keep running.

## Native connectors come first

If ThinkingMach has its own connector for an app, use that. It is the path ThinkingMach reviews. An aggregator is for the app that has no native connector.

## The four providers

Each provider has its own catalog entry and its own connection. The setup screen shows the steps for the provider you picked, with a link to that provider's guide.

| Provider | What you paste | Sign-in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Arcade** | The MCP gateway URL for a gateway you created in Arcade, with its tools selected. | Browser sign-in when the gateway asks for it. |
| **Composio** | Nothing, usually: the **Composio Connect** URL is prefilled. Replace it only if you set up a Composio session elsewhere. | Browser sign-in with your Composio account. |
| **Executor** | The MCP URL from your Executor workspace's connection instructions. A self-hosted endpoint works if ThinkingMach can reach it. | Browser sign-in when prompted. |
| **Zapier** | The complete server URL from a Zapier MCP server, token included. See [Zapier](zapier.md). | None — the token is part of the URL, so treat the URL as a secret. |

## Set one up

1. In the left sidebar, select **Connectors**, find the provider, and select it.
2. **Access.** Choose which humans can use the connection and which agents may use it. These are the same choices every connector asks for; [Share a connector with people and agents](share-access.md) explains them.
3. **Connect.** Paste the address into **MCP server URL** and select **Connect**. ThinkingMach shows *"Connecting and discovering tools…"* while it reaches the server and reads its tool list.
4. If the provider needs a sign-in, a provider window opens. Finish there and come back; ThinkingMach waits for confirmation.
5. Review **Permissions** and set each tool to **Allowed**, **Ask first**, or **Off**, as on any connector — see [Set action permissions](action-permissions.md).

A URL that is not an MCP endpoint is caught straight away with *"Enter a valid MCP URL"*. A dashboard page is not an MCP endpoint, so copy the server URL the provider gives you.

### Advanced authentication

Most setups need nothing more than the URL. If your provider gave you a token or headers instead of a browser sign-in, open **Advanced authentication** and pick one of:

- **Automatic (sign in if required)** — the default for providers that support browser sign-in.
- **Bearer token** — paste the token only, without the word Bearer.
- **Custom headers** — add each header name and value the provider supplied.
- **No additional authentication** — the URL alone is enough.

Two provider-specific notes from the setup screen: for Arcade headers, use an API key as the bearer token and add the `Arcade-User-ID` header for the acting user. For Executor, an API key must be a user key; workspace and organization keys cannot open an MCP session.

### If sign-in does not finish

Cancelling the sign-in does not lose your work. ThinkingMach shows *"Connection cancelled. Your setup details are preserved; try again when you are ready."* and the button becomes **Try again**. If you need to stop partway, you can leave and pick it up later — the connection shows **Resume setup** with your access choices intact.

## What ThinkingMach controls, and what it does not

ThinkingMach controls access to the tools it lists for the connection. App and action permissions inside those tools are managed in the provider.

So set up both layers deliberately:

- In the provider, connect only the apps you need and expose only the actions you need.
- In ThinkingMach, start writes at **Off** or **Ask first**, and run **Refresh tools** after you change the provider's setup, then review what appeared.

## Old Composio connections

Composio connections made through ThinkingMach's earlier Composio integration no longer run. Add a new Composio connection from **Connectors**, set it up, then remove the old one. Credentials and permissions do not carry over. [Providers ThinkingMach recognizes but does not list](recognized-providers.md#composio-listed-again-old-connections-retired) has the details.
