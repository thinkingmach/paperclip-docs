# Composio

Composio lets agents discover and use apps through Composio Connect. App authorization happens in Composio as well as access selection in ThinkingMach.

Composio is available on every instance; no experimental setting is required.

## Before you connect

- A Composio account and access to the apps you intend to authorize.
- For an externally configured session, its URL and required headers from its owner.

## Connect Composio

> **Unverified setup:** This procedure follows the pinned ThinkingMach definition and Composio's documentation. It has not been tested with a live Composio connection. Each step below is unverified.

1. **Unverified:** Open **Connectors** and select **Composio**.
2. **Unverified:** Read the access line above the main button. Select **Change** to choose the identity or narrow the agents that may use it.
3. **Unverified:** Select **Connect Composio** to use the prefilled `https://connect.composio.dev/mcp` endpoint and complete browser sign-in. For an externally configured session, replace the **MCP server URL** with its URL, then select **Change** and add its required headers under **Authentication**.
4. **Unverified:** Finish the connection check and inspect the exposed actions in ThinkingMach.
5. **Unverified:** When Composio requests authorization for an upstream app, inspect the app and requested access before completing that separate browser flow.

Do not substitute a legacy server-creation recipe for Composio Connect. Composio now documents sessions for SDK-created endpoints; use the instructions for the endpoint you actually have.

## Choose access

Tools come from your Composio account and appear in ThinkingMach when you connect. Composio Connect exposes discovery and execution actions that can reach upstream apps. ThinkingMach's setting for an execution action governs that exposed call; it does not provide a separate permission switch for every operation nested inside it.

Every tool starts as **Allowed**. Review broad execution and connection-management actions on **Permissions** and choose **Ask first** or **Off** as appropriate. Restrict upstream app authorizations in Composio too.

## Try it

Ask an eligible agent to discover a read-only lookup in an app you have authorized. Approve only a lookup, compare its result with the app, and inspect the connector call.

> **Unverified check:** Suggested test, not a recorded result. Discovery alone does not prove that app execution is authorized.

## Troubleshooting and limitations

| Problem | Check |
| --- | --- |
| An app asks for sign-in | Complete its separate Composio authorization; ThinkingMach access does not authorize the app. |
| An authorization link expired | Request a new link through Composio. |
| A configured session refuses access | Verify its URL and required headers with the session owner. |
| An app action fails | Check the app connection in Composio and reauthorize it if needed. |

The connector's reach depends on upstream accounts and the selected endpoint. Removing an agent's ThinkingMach access does not delete those upstream authorizations.
