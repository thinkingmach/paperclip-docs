# Google Workspace Search

> **Warning:** **Google verification pending.** ThinkingMach has not yet completed Google app verification. You may see an unverified-app warning during authorization. If Google offers an **Advanced** option to continue to ThinkingMach, you can choose to proceed after reviewing the requested access. This option is not available for every account; Workspace administrator restrictions and other Google access requirements still apply. Contact [support@thinkingmach.com](mailto:support@thinkingmach.com) if you cannot connect.

One read-only search that spans Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Chat together, so an agent can answer "where did we discuss this?" without knowing which app holds the answer.

It searches all four. There is no way to connect it for a subset.

> **Warning:** This connection requests read access to Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Chat at once. That is broader than any single-app connector. If an agent only needs one app, connect that app instead.

## When to use this instead of an app connector

| You want | Use |
| --- | --- |
| To find something without knowing which app it is in | This connector |
| To read, edit, or create in one specific app | [Gmail](gmail.md), [Google Drive](google-drive.md), [Google Calendar](google-calendar.md), or [Google Chat](google-chat.md) |
| The narrowest possible access | The single-app connector, with its read-only group |

This connector only searches. It returns results with links; it does not read a full document, create a draft, or change an event. Agents that need to act on what they find also need the relevant app connector.

## Before you connect

- A Google Workspace account whose mail, files, calendar, and chat you are willing to make searchable.
- Google Workspace Developer Preview registration for that account, confirmed by Google. Apply at [Google Workspace Developer Preview](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview).
- Without ThinkingMach Cloud enrollment, your own Google OAuth client with the **Gmail API**, **Drive API**, **Calendar API**, **Chat API**, and **Workspace MCP API** enabled — five APIs, more than any single-app connector needs. [Set up your own Google OAuth app](google-setup.md) is the complete procedure.

## Connect Google Workspace Search

1. Open **Connectors** and select **Google Workspace Search**.
2. On the **Access** step, choose the identity and which agents may use the connection.
3. Select **Connect with ThinkingMach**, or **Use your own Google OAuth app** — the latter needs the client ID and secret from [Set up your own Google OAuth app](google-setup.md).
4. Complete Google's consent screen with the registered Workspace account.

One capability group, **Search Workspace**, requesting `gmail.readonly`, `drive.readonly`, `calendar.readonly`, and `chat.messages.readonly`. There is a single operation, `search-corpus`.

## Choose access

What the search covers is what the authorizing account can already see across those four apps — its own mail, files shared with it, calendars on its list, and spaces it belongs to. ThinkingMach does not narrow it, and there is no per-app or per-folder filter.

Because the scope is wide, the agent-selection choice matters more than usual. Prefer **Just agents I pick**. An **Organization identity** here lets eligible agents search the connected account on runs whose responsible person is in the credential's human audience — rarely what you want.

[How connector access works](access-model.md) covers identity and agent selection.

## Try it

Search for something you know exists and can recognize in the results:

```txt
Search my Google Workspace for "renewal contract" and tell me which app each result came from.
```

Expect a handful of results, each identifying its source app with a link. Compare each result with a known item and inspect the connector calls. One query verifies only the returned results; it does not establish that all four services were searched successfully.

> **Note:** Illustrative task, not a recorded test result. Use a phrase you know appears in your own mail or files.

## Troubleshooting and limitations

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Google refuses before the consent screen | Developer Preview registration is incomplete | Finish registration and retry |
| **Connect with ThinkingMach** is not offered | The instance is not enrolled with ThinkingMach Cloud, or Cloud is not advertising the search profile | Use your own Google OAuth app |
| Results only ever come from one app | The query matches in one corpus, or the account has little content in the others | Try a phrase you know appears elsewhere |
| A result is found but the agent cannot read the whole item | Expected — this connector searches, it does not read | Add the relevant app connector |
| You need a connection dedicated to Drive | This connection requests access across multiple Workspace services | Use [Google Drive](google-drive.md) and review its scopes and actions |
| **Needs attention** | The Google token expired or was revoked | Select **Reconnect** |

Limitations: read-only and search-only, using one authorized account. Results depend on Google's search tools and that account's access. Developer Preview applies.
