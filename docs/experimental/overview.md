# Experimental features

ThinkingMach ships some features behind opt-in flags before they become default behavior. They're real, working features — you can turn them on today — but they're still being evaluated against real usage, so they live on a dedicated **Experimental** settings page instead of being on for everyone.

This section has one page per experimental feature: why it exists, how to turn it on, and how to use it.

![The Experimental settings page](../user-guides/screenshots/light/settings/experimental.png)

## What "experimental" means

An experimental feature in ThinkingMach:

- **Has shipped and works.** These aren't stubs — each flag gates a complete surface.
- **Is opt-in.** Everything stays hidden until you flip the flag, so the UI stays out of your way if you don't use it.
- **Comes with no compatibility guarantees.** The app puts it plainly when you open the page: *"Experimental features may break at any time. These features are opt-in and come with no compatibility guarantees. They may change, break, or be removed without notice. Avoid relying on them for critical or production workflows."*

Turning a flag on is not dangerous in the "this will corrupt your data" sense, and flipping one back off is always safe — features are hidden, not deleted, and any data they created is kept. But don't build a workflow that has to stay stable on top of one, and expect to re-read the release notes after an upgrade: experimental features may be renamed, reworked, promoted to core settings, or retired between releases.

## Turning a feature on

All experimental flags live in one place, and they're instance-wide (they apply to every company on your ThinkingMach instance):

1. Open **Settings → Instance settings → Experimental**.
2. Find the feature's card and flip its toggle.

Changes take effect immediately — no restart, no migration. Each feature page in this section repeats the exact toggle name to look for.

## If a toggle is locked

On an instance managed by ThinkingMach Cloud, some of these features are decided for you. Open the Experimental page there and you'll see a small lock badge reading **Managed by ThinkingMach Cloud** next to the feature's name, and its toggle greyed out — the switch still shows you whether the feature is on or off, you just can't move it. Clicking it does nothing.

That's not a permission problem with your account. ThinkingMach Cloud sets those values for the fleet your instance runs in, and the app re-applies them every time it reads the settings, so the answer can't drift — nothing you or anyone else does inside the instance changes a managed value. If you need one of these features turned on or off, that's a change on the ThinkingMach Cloud side rather than something you flip on this page.

Only some features are managed this way. Anything without the badge is still yours to turn on and off exactly as described above, and the two kinds sit side by side in the same list — so the badge is what tells you which is which, on any given release.

**Self-hosted instances are unaffected.** If you run ThinkingMach yourself, there is no managed configuration, no lock badge, and every card on the page stays editable. What makes the difference is a single environment variable, [`THINKINGMACH_MANAGED_CONFIG`](../reference/deploy/environment-variables.md#cloud-managed-instances), which only the ThinkingMach Cloud harness sets.

## The features

| Feature | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| [Environments](environments.md) | Environment management in settings, plus project and agent environment assignment — including custom sandbox images. |
| [Isolated Workspaces](isolated-workspaces.md) | Execution-workspace controls: per-run isolated copies of a project so agents don't step on each other. |
| [Experimental File Viewer](file-viewer.md) | Task-detail controls for browsing and previewing workspace files relative to a task. |
| [External Objects](external-objects.md) | Detects external URLs in issues and shows live status for referenced pull requests, tickets, and other work objects. |
| [Task Plan Decomposition Panel](plan-decomposition-panel.md) | Shows accepted-plan decomposition history on task detail pages. |
| [Chat-Style Tasks](task-chat.md) | Rebuilds the task detail page as a live conversation: chat bubbles, streaming activity that folds into a one-line summary, a three-mode composer, and a resizable Properties · Plan · Artifacts pane. |
| [Task Watchdogs](task-watchdogs.md) | Watchdog agents that verify stopped task subtrees and restore live paths when work should continue. |
| [Status Cards](status-cards.md) | A shared board of living summaries: one message per card, compiled into a watch query and kept current by the Summarizer. |
| [Cloud Sync](cloud-sync.md) | **Retired.** Host-to-host Cloud Sync has been removed upstream, toggle included — you won't find it on the Experimental page any more. Use [company Import/Export](../how-to/back-up-and-restore-a-company.md) to move a company between instances. |
| [Server Info Debug View](server-info-debug-view.md) | A "Server" section in the account drawer with the server restart time and running commit. |
| [Auto-Restart Dev Server When Idle](auto-restart-dev-server.md) | For ThinkingMach developers: restarts a stale `pnpm dev:once` boot once all local runs finish. |
| [Auto-Create Recovery Tasks](auto-create-recovery-tasks.md) | Lets the scheduler create recovery tasks for stalled task dependency chains. |

## Where to go next
