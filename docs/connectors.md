# Connectors

A **connector** is a saved connection to an outside service: a Gmail mailbox, a GitHub organization, a Notion workspace, a PostHog project. You set one up once, decide who and what it is for, and ThinkingMach carries that decision into every run.

> **Note:** These guides cover the connector model in ThinkingMach **v2026.916.0**. Available methods depend on your installed version, instance configuration, and provider approval. A catalog listing does not by itself establish that provider sign-in is available.

> **Warning:** **Google verification pending.** ThinkingMach has not yet completed Google app verification. You may see an unverified-app warning during authorization. If Google offers an **Advanced** option to continue to ThinkingMach, you can choose to proceed after reviewing the requested access. This option is not available for every account; Workspace administrator restrictions and other Google access requirements still apply. Contact [support@thinkingmach.com](mailto:support@thinkingmach.com) if you cannot connect.

## Start here

- [Connect your first connector](connectors/first-connector.md) — a worked setup, end to end, finishing with one read-only task an agent actually runs.
- [How connector access works](connectors/access-model.md) — identities, grants, agent selection, and what "effective policy" means.

## What you can connect

The **Connectors** list holds three kinds of connection. They look alike — each one is a credential ThinkingMach stores for you — but you set them up differently and different people use them.

**App integrations** let agents work with information and actions inside an app you already use: read a Notion page, open a Linear issue, look at a Sentry error, search a Drive folder. Setup ends in a list of individual actions you switch on or off. The agent starts the work.

**Model providers** supply the credential ThinkingMach uses to run models. Setup ends in a stored key or subscription, and there is no action list, because nothing here is a tool an agent can call. ThinkingMach uses it on the agent's behalf whenever the agent thinks. If you have ever wondered why your Anthropic connection has no permissions to set, this is why.

**Chat channels — Experimental** let people talk to your agents from a messaging app. An administrator must enable **Chat connectors**, which is off by default. Setup connects a provider app or bot to ThinkingMach; eligible messages can start or continue agent tasks.

One service can do more than one of these. Slack offers an app integration and an experimental chat channel, configured separately with separate credentials. Google Chat is an app integration: agents read and post in it, but people cannot use it to talk to an agent. GitHub is listed under Developer tools, including its separate issue and pull-request workflows.

## Connection methods

Every row in the catalog lists the methods that connector supports. The names mean the same thing everywhere:

| Method | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Connect with ThinkingMach | ThinkingMach holds the OAuth client and you approve access in the provider's own consent screen. Offered only on instances enrolled with ThinkingMach Cloud. |
| Sign in with the provider | ThinkingMach registers itself with the provider's authorization server at connect time, then you approve access there. Nothing to create first. |
| Your own OAuth app | You register an OAuth client with the provider and add ThinkingMach's callback URI before connecting. Use this when the provider does not support automatic registration, or when you want the client to be yours. |
| API key | You generate a key or token in the provider's console and paste it into ThinkingMach. |
| Provider app registration | You create an app or bot in the provider's developer console, give it the documented permissions and events, and connect its credentials. Provider-specific channel guides describe exceptions, such as managed inboxes. |
| No credential | Nothing to sign in to. You identify the target — a store domain, a generated URL, a shared file — and that is the whole setup. |

Which methods you actually see depends on your instance. **Connect with ThinkingMach** is hidden unless your instance is enrolled with ThinkingMach Cloud and Cloud advertises a profile for that connector. Every chat channel, and AgentMail's email inboxes with them, is behind the **Chat connectors** instance setting, which is off by default. Each connector page lists its own prerequisites.

### Google Workspace

| Connector | What you can do | Connection methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Gmail](connectors/gmail.md) | Google's email service. Agents search and read mail, and on a draft connection create drafts for you to review in Gmail. Sending, deleting, and relabelling mail are never enabled. | Connect with ThinkingMach · Your own OAuth app |
| [Google Calendar](connectors/google-calendar.md) | Google's calendar. Agents read calendars, and on a write connection create and change events. | Connect with ThinkingMach · Your own OAuth app |
| [Google Chat](connectors/google-chat.md) | Google Workspace's team messaging. Agents search and read conversations, and on a write connection post messages. This is an agent tool, not a way for people to talk to an agent. | Connect with ThinkingMach · Your own OAuth app |
| [Google Docs](connectors/google-docs.md) | Google's word processor. Agents read documents, and on a write connection edit them. | Connect with ThinkingMach · Your own OAuth app |

### AI tools

Services whose subject matter is machine learning. They are ordinary app integrations with action lists, which is what separates them from the [model providers](#model-providers) below.

| Connector | What you can do | Connection methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Hugging Face](connectors/hugging-face.md) | Public hub for open machine-learning models, datasets, and demos. Agents search models, datasets, and Spaces. The sign-in asks for a read-only scope, which makes this the shortest connector to try first. | Sign in with Hugging Face |
| [Mem0](connectors/mem0.md) | Hosted long-term memory for AI applications. Agents store and recall facts across runs in your Mem0 project. | API key |

### Model providers

These hold the credential ThinkingMach uses to run models. They publish no actions and appear in no permission list. See [Agent adapters](guides/org/agent-adapters.md) for which adapter uses which provider.

| Connector | What you can do | Connection methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Anthropic](connectors/anthropic.md) | Run Claude models. A subscription signs in with your Claude plan; an API key can be scoped and rotated separately. | Claude subscription · API key |
| [OpenAI](connectors/openai.md) | Run OpenAI models. | OpenAI subscription · API key |
| [OpenRouter](connectors/openrouter.md) | Run models from many vendors through one credential and one bill. | API key |
| [Grok](connectors/xai.md) | Run xAI's Grok models. | Grok subscription · API key |

<span id="chat-channels"></span>

### Chat channels — Experimental

These give people a place to talk to an agent. They require an administrator to enable **Chat connectors** in the instance's experimental settings; the setting is off by default. Setup registers an app or bot with the provider and points it at a ThinkingMach webhook; one connection carries one agent.

| Connector | What you can do | Connection methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Discord](connectors/discord.md) | Mention the agent in a server channel and ThinkingMach opens a thread, keeping it tied to one task. | Provider app registration |
| [iMessage Photon](connectors/imessage-photon.md) | Message the agent from Apple Messages through a Photon Cloud project. Shared Pro lines carry direct messages; a dedicated line also carries groups you enable. | Provider app registration |
| [Microsoft Teams](connectors/microsoft-teams.md) | Message the agent in a chat, a team channel, or a group chat. Needs a work or school Microsoft 365 organization; personal Teams accounts cannot complete the setup. | Provider app registration |
| [Slack](connectors/slack.md) | Message the agent directly, or mention it in a channel to start a task from that thread. Set up separately from the Slack agent tool on the same page. | Provider app registration |
| [Telegram](connectors/telegram.md) | Message the agent through a bot you create with BotFather. | Provider app registration |

## Can't find your app?

The catalog above describes the documented connectors for this release. If the service you want is not in it, these are the paths that exist.

**Check your own instance first.** Your installed version may offer a different catalog, and the methods it offers you depend on whether the instance is enrolled with ThinkingMach Cloud and whether chat channels are switched on. What **Connectors** shows you is authoritative; this page is not.

**Connect it as a custom server.** If the service publishes its own remote MCP server, you can connect it directly without waiting for a catalog entry. It gets the same identity, grant, agent-selection, and per-action controls as a catalog connector. See [Connect a custom MCP server](connectors/custom-mcp-servers.md) for the compatibility requirements and the two ways to supply a URL.

**Reach it through automation you already own.** [Zapier](connectors/zapier.md) covers a long tail of apps that have no MCP server of their own. You pick the actions on Zapier's side, which also means the agent cannot exceed them.

**Give the agent a workspace instead.** Some work does not need a connector at all. Anything an agent can do with a shell and a CLI belongs in an execution workspace — see [Connect an agent to a GitHub repo](how-to/connect-agent-to-github.md) for the pattern, and [Add an MCP server to an agent](how-to/add-mcp-server-to-agent.md) for the adapter-level route.

**If the provider gates access.** A few providers review and approve MCP clients before an independently registered one will work. Nothing you do in ThinkingMach changes that, and the approval has to come from the provider. [Providers ThinkingMach recognizes but does not list](connectors/recognized-providers.md) names the ones in this snapshot and what each is waiting on.

## What a connection does not grant

Two things surprise people, and both are worth knowing before you connect anything.

**A connector is not a permission.** Connecting Notion does not let every agent edit your Notion. The connection holds the credential; a separate set of choices decides which humans it belongs to, which agents may use it, and which individual actions those agents may call. [How connector access works](connectors/access-model.md) is the short version, and [Set action permissions](connectors/action-permissions.md) is the control itself.

**Most action lists come from the provider, not from ThinkingMach.** For a connector that talks to a provider-hosted server, the provider publishes the tools. ThinkingMach reads that list, classifies each entry as read, write, or destructive, and lets you set each one to **Allowed**, **Ask first**, or **Off**. When the provider changes its server, your list changes with it — so the authoritative list of what a connector can do is the one in your own instance, not the one on its page here.

## Shared guides

Use these guides for the controls your connector exposes. Action permissions and review requests apply to agent-tool connections; model credentials and chat channels have different controls.

| Guide | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| [Share a connector with people and agents](connectors/share-access.md) | Deciding who the credential belongs to and which agents may use it. |
| [Use separate accounts for people and agents](connectors/separate-accounts.md) | One agent needs its own account rather than borrowing a person's. |
| [Set action permissions](connectors/action-permissions.md) | Turning individual actions to Allowed, Ask first, or Off. |
| [Answer a connector review request](connectors/review-requests.md) | An agent is waiting on your OK for an Ask-first action. |
| [Verify a connector and fix a broken one](connectors/verify-and-troubleshoot.md) | Checking a new connection, or a working one has stopped. |
| [Reauthorize, revoke, or disconnect](connectors/reauthorize-and-disconnect.md) | Rotating a credential, removing one person's access, or deleting the connection. |
| [Connect a custom MCP server](connectors/custom-mcp-servers.md) | The service is not in the catalog, or you have a URL or config to paste. |
