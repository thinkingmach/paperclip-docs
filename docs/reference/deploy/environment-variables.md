# Environment Variables

This page lists the environment variables ThinkingMach reads for server configuration and the variables it injects into agent processes at runtime.

Use it when you are wiring a deployment, debugging a startup issue, or checking what an adapter can see inside its process environment.

---

## Server Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3100` | Server port |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Server host binding |
| `DATABASE_URL` | embedded PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` | falls back to `DATABASE_URL` | Optional PostgreSQL URL used only when running migrations — useful when your runtime user lacks DDL rights and a separate role applies schema changes. |
| `THINKINGMACH_HOME` | `~/.paperclip` | Base directory for all ThinkingMach data |
| `THINKINGMACH_INSTANCE_ID` | `default` | Instance identifier for multiple local instances |
| `THINKINGMACH_DEPLOYMENT_MODE` | `local_trusted` | Runtime mode override |
| `SERVE_UI` | `true` (from `server.serveUi` in `config.json`) | When set, overrides the file-config flag that controls whether the server serves the bundled UI. `SERVE_UI=true` enables it; `SERVE_UI=false` disables it. |
| `THINKINGMACH_BIND` | inferred from `HOST` | Bind mode for the server socket. One of the values in `BIND_MODES` (see `packages/shared`); overrides `server.bind` in `config.json`. |
| `THINKINGMACH_BIND_HOST` | inferred | Custom host when `THINKINGMACH_BIND` is set to a custom mode; overrides `server.customBindHost`. |
| `THINKINGMACH_TAILNET_BIND_HOST` | auto-detected via `tailscale ip -4` | Tailnet IPv4 address the server binds to when bind mode is `tailnet`. Set explicitly to skip the `tailscale` CLI probe. |
| `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_GIT_SCAN_CONCURRENCY` | `2` | How many expensive full-tree workspace Git scans may run at once. Clamped to 1–16. |
| `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_GIT_SCAN_QUEUE_CAPACITY` | `32` | How many scans may wait in the queue before new ones are rejected. Clamped to 0–1024. |
| `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_GIT_SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS` | `8000` | Per-scan timeout, in milliseconds, before a workspace Git scan is abandoned. Clamped to 100–120000. |
| `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_GIT_SCAN_CACHE_TTL_MS` | `10000` | How long a completed scan's result is reused before a fresh scan runs, in milliseconds. Clamped to 0–60000. |
| `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_REAPER_COOLDOWN_DAYS` | `7` | How many days the terminal-workspace reaper waits after an issue tree becomes terminal before archiving its workspace. Someone can reopen the work inside this window. `0` disables the cooldown and restores immediate reaping; a negative or non-numeric value falls back to the default. |

> **Note:** `DATABASE_URL` is the main switch between the embedded database and external PostgreSQL.

---

## Deployment And Auth

These variables matter most once you move beyond a default local install.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_PUBLIC_URL` | Canonical public URL for invites, redirects, and auth origin wiring. |
| `THINKINGMACH_AUTH_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Explicit auth base URL when you want Better Auth to use a fixed public origin. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Alternate Better Auth base URL input. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Signing secret for Better Auth sessions and tokens. Falls back to `THINKINGMACH_AGENT_JWT_SECRET` when unset; the server refuses to start if neither is configured. For local development the `.env.example` ships `paperclip-dev-secret`. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_BASE_URL` | Alternate Better Auth base URL input used by some deployments. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated allowlist of trusted auth origins. |
| `THINKINGMACH_AGENT_JWT_SECRET` | Secret used to mint agent API JWTs. Required for local adapter auth. |
| `THINKINGMACH_AGENT_JWT_TTL_SECONDS` | Agent JWT lifetime in seconds. |
| `THINKINGMACH_AGENT_JWT_ISSUER` | Agent JWT issuer. |
| `THINKINGMACH_AGENT_JWT_AUDIENCE` | Agent JWT audience. |
| `THINKINGMACH_TOOL_ACTION_SIGNING_SECRET` | Signing secret for tool action approvals. Unlike `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` it has no fallback — if it is unset, the server cannot issue signed tool action approvals and raises `ToolActionSigningSecretMissingError`. Set it in the instance's own environment; worktrees inherit it from `.paperclip/.env`. For local development the `.env.example` ships `paperclip-dev-tool-action-signing-secret-change-me`. |

Related deployment variables:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_DEPLOYMENT_EXPOSURE` | Exposure policy override, typically `private` or `public` in authenticated mode. |
| `THINKINGMACH_AUTH_BASE_URL_MODE` | Base URL handling mode, such as `auto` or `explicit`. |
| `THINKINGMACH_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES` | Comma-separated allowlist for authenticated/private host validation. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | How much to trust the `X-Forwarded-For` header when the server sits behind a reverse proxy or load balancer. Defaults to unset (trust nothing). See below. |

> **Tip:** If `thinkingmach doctor` is failing on hostnames, redirects, or auth origins, inspect this group first.

### Trusting a reverse proxy (`TRUST_PROXY`)

When you run ThinkingMach behind a load balancer or reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, a cloud LB), the real client IP arrives in the `X-Forwarded-For` header rather than on the socket. `TRUST_PROXY` tells the server how far to trust that header so `req.ip` and rate-limiting see the actual client instead of your proxy.

The default is **unset**, which trusts nothing — the safe choice, because an untrusted client can otherwise spoof its address by sending its own `X-Forwarded-For`. Only opt in when there really is a proxy in front of the server.

Accepted values:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| unset, `""`, `false`, `0` | Trust nothing. The default. |
| `true` | Trust the header unconditionally. **Unsafe** unless the server is unreachable except through your proxy. |
| a positive integer (e.g. `1`) | Trust that many proxy hops. Use `1` for a single LB in front of the server. |
| a comma-separated list | Trust specific sources by named subnet (`loopback`, `linklocal`, `uniquelocal`) or CIDR (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8`, `fd00::/8`). |

A malformed value (a stray sign, leading zeros, or an unrecognised token) makes the server **refuse to start** with an explanatory error, so a typo fails loudly rather than silently disabling proxy trust. After setting it, confirm `req.ip` in the request log matches the real client IP through your proxy.

---

## Cloud-Managed Instances

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_MANAGED_CONFIG` | unset (self-hosted) | Set only by the ThinkingMach Cloud harness. Holds one JSON document describing which experimental feature flags the harness manages for this instance, the plugin keys it declares for auto-install, and optionally the sandbox environment it provisions for you at boot. **Absent** means self-hosted: no overlay, no behavior change. **Present but blank, or malformed, makes the server refuse to start.** |

You don't set this variable yourself. It exists so that a hosted instance gets its feature configuration from the fleet that runs it rather than from its own database, and it's documented here so you can recognise it in a running container's environment.

The value is a single JSON document:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "mode": "cloud",
  "catalogVersion": "2026.720.0",
  "features": { "enableApps": false, "enableCases": true },
  "plugins": { "autoInstall": ["daytona", "kubernetes"] },
  "environments": [
    { "name": "Daytona", "provider": "daytona", "config": { "target": "us" } }
  ]
}
```

Six top-level keys are allowed — `v`, `mode`, `catalogVersion`, `features`, `plugins`, and `environments` — and anything else makes the server refuse to start.

Five of them are required: `v`, `mode`, `catalogVersion`, `features`, and `plugins.autoInstall`, though `features` may be `{}` and `plugins.autoInstall` may be `[]`. `mode` is always `"cloud"`, and `catalogVersion` records the feature-catalog version the document was validated against.

`environments` is the one **optional** section. It arrived later than the others, and documents delivered before it existed still have to boot on newer builds — a fleet image roll can't be lockstepped with a config re-delivery — so leaving it out simply means "this instance declares no managed environment". That's different from a missing `features` or `plugins.autoInstall`, where absence would silently drop a control the harness meant to be in force. When the section *is* present, it's validated just as strictly as everything else. [The sandbox environment it provisions](#the-sandbox-environment-it-provisions) below has the details.

### It fails closed

Only an **absent** variable means self-hosted. Everything else is treated as a harness misconfiguration and stops the server at startup with a precise error, so a truncated or mistyped document can never silently drop a control that was supposed to be in force. The server refuses to start when the variable is:

- set but blank (unset it entirely for self-hosted mode)
- not valid JSON, or not a JSON object
- carrying an unknown top-level key, or a `v` other than `1`, or a `mode` other than `"cloud"`
- missing `features` or `plugins.autoInstall`
- naming a feature key this build doesn't have, or one whose feature-catalog tier isn't `managed`
- giving a non-boolean value for a feature, or a blank/duplicate plugin key
- carrying a malformed `environments` section — more than one entry, an unknown key inside an entry, a blank `name` or `provider`, a `provider` that isn't also listed in `plugins.autoInstall`, a `config` that sets `provider` itself, or a `config` key that looks like a credential

### What it can and can't reach

`features` may only target the boolean feature-flag keys of the instance's experimental settings — the ones on **Settings → Instance settings → Experimental**. Server-managed bookkeeping fields (activation cutoffs, lookback hours) aren't booleans and are excluded by construction, so a managed document can't touch them.

On top of that, each flag carries a tier in the build's feature catalog: `preference` (a tenant's own taste setting the harness leaves alone), `managed` (the harness may set it), or `floor` (pinned in code). Only `managed` keys are accepted. A key whose tier differs in the running build is version skew between the document's `catalogVersion` and the app, and the server refuses to start rather than apply a control with mismatched semantics.

ThinkingMach publishes that tier map per release as a `feature-catalog.json` artifact — generated by `scripts/generate-feature-catalog.ts --version <catalogVersion>` — which the cloud harness imports and validates its feature writes against.

### Nothing is written to the database

The overlay is never persisted. The values are applied when settings are read, which means they re-assert on every read — a database restore or a hand-edited settings row cannot resurrect a capability the harness disabled.

In the UI, every key the overlay controls renders with a lock badge reading **Managed by ThinkingMach Cloud** and a disabled toggle. Self-hosted responses carry no managed keys at all, so every toggle stays editable. See [Experimental features](../../experimental/overview.md#if-a-toggle-is-locked) for the user-facing view.

### The sandbox environment it provisions

If you open **Settings → Instance settings → Environments** on a hosted instance and find a sandbox environment already waiting there — one you never created — the `environments` section is where it came from. The fleet declares it, and the server sets it up for you on boot so agents have somewhere to run without you wiring up a provider first.

The feature overlay above is read-time only, but this part is different: an entry provisions a real environment row you can see in the UI, and the server re-applies it on every boot. That's safe to repeat — the step is idempotent, so a restart refreshes the row rather than piling up duplicates.

Each entry looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Daytona",
  "description": "Managed sandboxes for agent runs",
  "provider": "daytona",
  "config": { "target": "us" }
}
```

- **`name`** is the display name of the environment row.
- **`description`** is optional. It mirrors the document, so dropping it later clears the description rather than pinning the old one forever.
- **`provider`** is the sandbox plugin's driver key — the same key the plugin uses in `plugins.autoInstall`, like `daytona` or `kubernetes`. It has to appear in that auto-install list too: on a managed instance the fleet is the only way a plugin gets installed, so an environment whose provider plugin isn't provisioned could never serve a run. That mismatch is caught at startup rather than at the first run.
- **`config`** is stored verbatim on the environment row and validated by the provider plugin when it acquires a lease. See [Sandbox Providers](../adapters/sandbox-providers.md) for the fields each provider accepts.

### One entry, and never any credentials

Two rules shape what this section is allowed to declare.

**At most one entry.** The database enforces a single ThinkingMach-managed sandbox row per instance (a partial unique index named `environments_managed_sandbox_idx`), and every entry in the list provisions that one row — so a longer list could never be satisfied and is rejected at parse time. For the same reason, a **non-empty** `environments` section and a forced `THINKINGMACH_EXECUTION_MODE` are mutually exclusive: both claim the same row, and configuring both stops the server rather than letting boot order pick a winner. An empty `"environments": []` declares nothing, so it sits alongside a forced execution mode without complaint.

**No secrets, ever.** A managed-config document carries no credentials, so any `config` key that *looks* like one — matching `api_key`, `apiKey`, `token`, `secret`, `password`, or `credential`, at any nesting depth — is treated as a misrouted credential and refuses startup. Provider credentials reach a managed instance as ordinary process environment variables instead: every bundled sandbox provider falls back to its own documented variable, such as `DAYTONA_API_KEY`, when `config` leaves the key out.

### When the provider isn't ready

Provisioning waits for the bundled-plugin startup pass to finish, then checks that the entry's provider plugin is installed, `ready`, **and** running a live worker. A plugin whose record says `ready` but whose activation failed has no worker and can't serve a lease, so that check matters.

If the provider isn't up, ThinkingMach skips the entry rather than writing an active row — and if an earlier boot already provisioned one, it archives that row so run scheduling stops selecting an environment whose leases would fail. The server logs the reason and keeps booting; the cost is that this one environment is unavailable, not a fleet stuck in a crash loop.

Recovery is automatic in the common case. When the plugin record is `ready` and only its worker is down — a crash in restart-backoff — ThinkingMach listens for the worker manager to respawn it and re-runs the setup the moment it comes back, so the environment returns without anyone restarting the server. A missing or non-`ready` plugin needs the next healthy boot instead.

That's the same deliberate split you see elsewhere in the document: a **malformed** section refuses startup, while a **failed setup step** logs and boots degraded.

### Removing an entry doesn't remove the environment

Dropping the `environments` section, or the entry inside it, stops future refreshes — it does not delete or archive the environment row. This matches how `plugins.autoInstall` behaves ([Plugins](../../administration/plugins.md#what-it-wont-undo) covers the plugin side): runs may still hold leases against that environment, so withdrawing it is an explicit action someone takes, not a side effect of an edited document. The archiving described above is scoped to a provider that was declared but couldn't come up, never to an entry you removed.

## Secrets

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY` | 32-byte encryption key as base64, hex, or raw |
| `THINKINGMACH_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY_FILE` | Path to the local key file |
| `THINKINGMACH_SECRETS_STRICT_MODE` | Require secret refs for server-side env bindings. Does not apply to `thinkingmach configure --section llm` or `config.llm.apiKey`. |

These values are covered in more detail in [Secrets](./secrets.md).

---

## Storage

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_STORAGE_PROVIDER` | Storage backend, usually `local_disk` or `s3`. |
| `THINKINGMACH_STORAGE_LOCAL_DIR` | Base directory for local-disk storage. |
| `THINKINGMACH_STORAGE_S3_BUCKET` | S3 bucket name. |
| `THINKINGMACH_STORAGE_S3_REGION` | S3 region. |
| `THINKINGMACH_STORAGE_S3_ENDPOINT` | Custom S3-compatible endpoint for MinIO, R2, and similar providers. |
| `THINKINGMACH_STORAGE_S3_PREFIX` | Optional object key prefix. |
| `THINKINGMACH_STORAGE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | Enable path-style S3 requests when the provider needs them. |
| `THINKINGMACH_IMPORT_ZIP_MAX_BYTES` | Maximum size, in bytes, of a company-import `.zip` upload. Defaults to `1073741824` (1 GB). Set it higher to accept larger packages, or lower to tighten the cap. Values are clamped to the range 1 byte – 64 GiB; anything non-numeric, fractional-to-zero, or out of range falls back to the 1 GB default. |

---

## Scheduler

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `HEARTBEAT_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables or disables timer-based scheduling. |
| `HEARTBEAT_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MS` | `30000` | Scheduler poll interval in milliseconds. |

---

## Telemetry & Feedback Export

These variables control where the server forwards operator-submitted feedback (and the deprecated telemetry channel that backs the same export pipeline). They are read by `server/src/config.ts` and are only consulted when you want to ship feedback events off your instance to a separate collector.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_FEEDBACK_EXPORT_BACKEND_URL` | unset | URL of the external feedback collector. When set, the server forwards `thinkingmach feedback` submissions to this endpoint. |
| `THINKINGMACH_FEEDBACK_EXPORT_BACKEND_TOKEN` | unset | Bearer token used to authenticate the forwarding request. |
| `THINKINGMACH_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_URL` | unset | Legacy alias for `THINKINGMACH_FEEDBACK_EXPORT_BACKEND_URL`. Honoured for backwards compatibility — set the feedback variant in new deployments. |
| `THINKINGMACH_TELEMETRY_BACKEND_TOKEN` | unset | Legacy alias for `THINKINGMACH_FEEDBACK_EXPORT_BACKEND_TOKEN`. |

If neither variable is set, feedback submissions are stored locally and never leave the instance.

### Turning off telemetry

ThinkingMach ships anonymized usage telemetry (which adapters you run, and similar coarse signals) that helps the project understand how ThinkingMach is used. It carries no personal data, and you can turn it off completely by setting either of these variables. Both are checked for the exact value `1`, and either one on its own disables telemetry.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | Set to `1` to disable ThinkingMach's anonymized telemetry. |
| `DO_NOT_TRACK` | The cross-tool [Console Do Not Track](https://consoledonottrack.com/) convention. Set to `1` to disable telemetry. |

---

## Observability (OpenTelemetry)

ThinkingMach can emit distributed traces over OpenTelemetry (OTLP) so you can watch requests flow through the server in a tracing backend like Jaeger, Tempo, or Honeycomb. It is **opt-in and off by default** — nothing is loaded until you point it at a collector.

To turn it on, set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and install the OpenTelemetry packages the server needs (`@opentelemetry/sdk-node`, `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`, the exporter for your protocol, `@opentelemetry/resources`, and `@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions`). If the endpoint is set but the packages are missing, the server logs a one-line hint and keeps running without tracing.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | unset | OTLP collector endpoint. Setting it is the master switch that enables tracing. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | `grpc` | Exporter protocol: `grpc`, `http/protobuf`, or `http/json`. An unknown value logs a warning and falls back to `grpc`. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `paperclip` | Service name reported on spans. |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION` | `unknown` | Service version reported on spans. |

A bad endpoint or an unreachable collector never takes the server down — the SDK logs the failure and tracing simply stays off. On shutdown the server flushes buffered spans (with a short timeout) before exiting.

---

## Error Monitoring (Sentry)

ThinkingMach can report server-side errors to [Sentry](https://sentry.io). It is **opt-in and off by default**, and everything about it fails open — no DSN, no package, no Sentry, no problem.

To turn it on, set `SENTRY_DSN` and install the optional `@sentry/node` peer dependency. The DSN also rides the authenticated session response to the browser, so the web UI reports its own errors (behind a React error boundary) once the server has one configured.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SENTRY_DSN` | unset | Sentry DSN. Setting it, with `@sentry/node` installed, enables server-side error capture and hands the DSN to the browser for client-side reporting. Unset means no Sentry is loaded at all. |

---

## Operator Settings Controls

If you host ThinkingMach for other people, these two variables let you shape which settings surfaces your users see and what the defaults are. Both are read at boot, applied at read time, and **never persisted** — clearing the variable restores stock behavior. With both unset, the UI and API behave exactly as they did before these controls existed. See [Instance Settings](../../administration/settings.md) for the full walkthrough.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_HIDDEN_SETTINGS` | unset | Comma-separated list of settings-surface keys to hide from the UI — instance pages, company pages (Members, Invites, Secrets, Export, Import), individual sections and tabs, and individual experimental flags. Some keys also floor their mutation API with a `403`; the rest hide UI only. Unknown keys are warned about and ignored, so one list can roll across a fleet of mixed app versions. |
| `THINKINGMACH_SETTING_DEFAULTS` | unset | JSON object that replaces the schema default of selected instance settings, e.g. `{"feedbackDataSharingPreference":"allowed"}`. An explicit user choice always wins; only values still sitting at the schema default resolve to yours. Malformed JSON or an invalid value for a known field stops the server from booting; unknown field names are warned about and ignored. |

---

## Agent Runtime

The server injects these variables into agent processes when it starts a run:

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Variable | Always set? | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_AGENT_ID` | yes | Agent ID. |
| `THINKINGMACH_COMPANY_ID` | yes | Company ID. |
| `THINKINGMACH_API_URL` | yes | ThinkingMach API base URL. |
| `THINKINGMACH_API_KEY` | local adapters | Short-lived JWT for API auth. Use as `Authorization: Bearer $THINKINGMACH_API_KEY`. For non-local adapters, the operator sets this in adapter config. |
| `THINKINGMACH_RUN_ID` | yes | Current heartbeat run ID. Pass back as the `X-ThinkingMach-Run-Id` header on any request that mutates an issue, so server-side audit log entries link to this run. |
| `THINKINGMACH_TASK_ID` | wake-driven | Issue that triggered the wake. Empty for scheduled or unsolicited wakes. |
| `THINKINGMACH_WAKE_REASON` | wake-driven | Why this run was triggered. See enum below. |
| `THINKINGMACH_WAKE_COMMENT_ID` | comment wakes | Specific comment that triggered the wake (set with `issue_commented` and `issue_comment_mentioned`). |
| `THINKINGMACH_WAKE_PAYLOAD_JSON` | some adapters | Inline JSON wake payload: a compact issue summary plus the ordered batch of new comment payloads. Adapters that inject this let an agent skip the initial `GET /api/issues/:id` and `GET /api/issues/:id/comments` round-trips on comment wakes. |
| `THINKINGMACH_APPROVAL_ID` | approval wakes | Resolved approval ID. |
| `THINKINGMACH_APPROVAL_STATUS` | approval wakes | Approval decision. |
| `THINKINGMACH_LINKED_ISSUE_IDS` | optional | Comma-separated linked issue IDs. |

Use these values when your agent runtime needs to authenticate back to ThinkingMach or understand what context triggered the run.

### `THINKINGMACH_WAKE_REASON` values

| Value | When it fires |
|---|---|
| `issue_assigned` | A task was newly assigned to this agent. |
| `issue_commented` | A new comment was posted on an issue this agent owns. The triggering comment id is in `THINKINGMACH_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`. |
| `issue_comment_mentioned` | The agent was @-mentioned in a comment on an issue it does not own. |
| `issue_blockers_resolved` | Every issue listed in this issue's `blockedBy` reached `done`. |
| `issue_children_completed` | All direct children of this issue reached a terminal state (`done` or `cancelled`). |
| `approval_resolved` | An approval the agent requested was approved or rejected. `THINKINGMACH_APPROVAL_ID` and `THINKINGMACH_APPROVAL_STATUS` are populated. |
| `scheduled` | A scheduled run from the heartbeat scheduler or a routine cron. |
| `assignment` | Generic assignment-triggered run with no more specific reason. |

When ThinkingMach realizes an execution workspace, it can also inject workspace-specific variables such as:

- `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_CWD`
- `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_PATH`
- `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_REPO_ROOT`
- `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_BRANCH`
- `THINKINGMACH_PROJECT_ID`
- `THINKINGMACH_ISSUE_ID`

Those are mainly useful for adapter authors and agent-side tooling that need direct access to the resolved execution workspace.

> **Audit trail:** Every mutating API request from an agent run should include the `X-ThinkingMach-Run-Id: $THINKINGMACH_RUN_ID` header. The server uses it to attribute issue updates, comments, checkouts, and subtasks to the heartbeat run that produced them. Read-only requests do not require it.

### How `THINKINGMACH_*` env bindings reach the run

You can define your own environment variables on an agent, project, routine, or adapter config, and they flow into the run environment — including ones you deliberately name with a `THINKINGMACH_` prefix (for example a secret called `THINKINGMACH_CLOUD_PROD_PROVIDER_RAILWAY_TOKEN`). The server applies one simple policy when it builds each run's environment:

- **`THINKINGMACH_API_KEY` is never accepted** from your agent, project, routine, or adapter config. The harness mints a short-lived run token for every run, and that minted token is the only source of `THINKINGMACH_API_KEY`.
- **Harness-assigned runtime variables always win.** The variables ThinkingMach sets for the run itself (like `THINKINGMACH_RUN_ID`, `THINKINGMACH_AGENT_ID`, and the wake/workspace variables above) take precedence over any same-named binding you define, so you cannot accidentally shadow them.
- **Every other `THINKINGMACH_*` binding flows through** to the run environment just like a variable with no prefix. Naming a value with the `THINKINGMACH_` prefix no longer causes it to be dropped.

> **Upgrade note (v2026.722.0):** Earlier releases stripped *every* `THINKINGMACH_`-prefixed binding before resolving the run environment, which silently dropped custom secrets you had named with that prefix — those now pass through as expected. In the same change, a static `THINKINGMACH_API_KEY` you set in adapter or config env to override the run token no longer has any effect. If you relied on that override, drop it: the harness-minted run token is now the only source of the run API key.

---

## LLM Provider Keys

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key for `claude_local` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for `codex_local` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini API key for `gemini_local` |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Alternate Google API key path for `gemini_local` |

> **Tip:** If an adapter test is failing, start by checking whether the expected provider key is present in the process environment.

---

## Adapter Provider Overrides

The local CLI adapters can be pointed at a custom or remote OpenAI-compatible gateway through these server-read variables. Each takes a JSON value that ThinkingMach writes into the adapter's own runtime config before a run, so you can route an adapter at your own provider without editing the agent's machine by hand. The full JSON shape and behaviour for each live on the adapter's reference page.

| Variable | Adapter | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `THINKINGMACH_CODEX_PROVIDERS` | `codex_local` | JSON of custom providers (and an optional `model_provider`) written into Codex's managed `config.toml`. See [Codex](../adapters/codex.md). |
| `THINKINGMACH_PI_PROVIDERS` | `pi_local` | JSON of custom providers written into Pi's managed `models.json`. See [Pi](../adapters/pi.md). |
| `THINKINGMACH_OPENCODE_PROVIDERS` | `opencode_local` | JSON merged into OpenCode's `provider` config. See [OpenCode](../adapters/opencode.md). |
| `THINKINGMACH_OPENCODE_SMALL_MODEL` | `opencode_local` | Sets OpenCode's `small_model` (the auxiliary/helper model). See [OpenCode](../adapters/opencode.md). |

Values support `{env:VAR}` placeholders, which are expanded server-side so secrets stay out of the stored JSON.
