# Storage

ThinkingMach stores uploads such as attachments, screenshots, and other assets through a configurable storage provider.

Use this page when you need to understand where files live locally or when you are switching to object storage for a shared deployment.

---

## Storage Modes

| Provider | Best for |
|---|---|
| `local_disk` | Local development, single-machine use |
| `s3` | Production, multi-node, cloud deployments |

> **Note:** Storage configuration lives in the instance config file, not in the database schema.

---

## Local Disk

This is the default provider for local installs.

Files are stored at:

```txt
~/.paperclip/instances/default/data/storage
```

No additional setup is required. This is the right choice when the instance is local and single-node.

---

## S3-Compatible Storage

Use S3-compatible object storage when you want the instance to behave like a real shared deployment.

That includes providers such as:

- AWS S3
- MinIO
- Cloudflare R2

Configure it through the CLI:

```sh
pnpm thinkingmach configure --section storage
```

Use this when the instance may run on more than one machine or when local disk would not be durable enough.

---

## What Gets Stored

The storage layer is used for uploaded files that belong to company activity, including issue attachments and images.

If you are trying to track down a missing upload, verify both the storage provider and the instance data directory.

### Persistent agent files

An agent's personal files use the instance filesystem separately from the upload storage provider. Their saved directory is:

```txt
<instance>/companies/<company>/agents/<agent>/instructions/
```

This includes the instruction entry and any notes, folders, or binary files the agent keeps in its personal directory. Managed runs receive a writable copy through `AGENT_HOME`; task workspace files stay separate. Selecting S3 for uploads does not move these agent files to S3.

Include the saved agent directories in filesystem backups. A database backup alone cannot restore their bytes, and a company export is not a complete copy of this personal storage. See [Agents](../../guides/org/agents.md#agent-files-persist-across-tasks) for limits and sync behavior, and [Back up and restore a company](../../how-to/back-up-and-restore-a-company.md) for recovery boundaries.

> **Tip:** If a local upload disappears after a restart, check whether you were running inside a container or another ephemeral environment without the bind mount you expected.
