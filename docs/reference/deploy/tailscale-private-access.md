# Tailscale Private Access

Use this page when you want a ThinkingMach instance that is reachable from a private network, not just from `localhost`.

It is the practical path for `authenticated` + `private` deployments.

---

## Start In Private Mode

Start ThinkingMach with the private authenticated dev mode:

```sh
pnpm dev --tailscale-auth
```

Equivalent flag:

```sh
pnpm dev --authenticated-private
```

This configures:

- `THINKINGMACH_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=authenticated`
- `THINKINGMACH_DEPLOYMENT_EXPOSURE=private`
- `THINKINGMACH_AUTH_BASE_URL_MODE=auto`
- `HOST=0.0.0.0`

> **Note:** The bind address matters. If you leave the host on `localhost`, other devices on the private network will not be able to reach the app.

---

## Find The Reachable Address

From the machine that is running ThinkingMach:

```sh
tailscale ip -4
```

You can also use a MagicDNS hostname such as `my-macbook.tailnet.ts.net`.

---

## Open The Instance

Use the private-network host or IP with the ThinkingMach port:

```txt
http://<tailscale-host-or-ip>:3100
```

Example:

```txt
http://my-macbook.tailnet.ts.net:3100
```

---

## Allow Custom Hostnames

If you use a private hostname that ThinkingMach has not seen before, add it to the allowlist:

```sh
pnpm thinkingmach allowed-hostname my-macbook.tailnet.ts.net
```

Use this when the app redirects incorrectly or refuses a host that is valid inside your private network.

---

## Verify Connectivity

From another Tailscale-connected device:

```sh
curl http://<tailscale-host-or-ip>:3100/api/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If login or redirect errors mention the hostname, add it with `thinkingmach allowed-hostname`.
- If the app only works on `localhost`, confirm you started with `--tailscale-auth` or `--authenticated-private`.
- If local access works but remote access does not, verify both devices are on the same Tailscale network and that port `3100` is reachable.

> **Tip:** When debugging private access, test `curl /api/health` from a second device before spending time on browser redirects. It answers the connectivity question directly.
