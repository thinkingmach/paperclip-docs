# Prepare MCP Integration

> Take a new MCP or vendor integration from an input link or brief all the way to delivery — cited research first, an explicit human approval gate in the middle, then one governed ThinkingMach connector per approved connection.

A two-phase playbook for researching and shipping MCP/vendor integrations in a way people can review and sign off on. It turns a link or a short vendor brief into a cited research pull request, waits for a human to accept the exact revision, and only then writes the connector code — one ThinkingMach pull request per approved connection.

This is an **optional** catalog skill — opt-in (install when you need it). For how to install, audit, update, assign, and reset catalog skills, see the [Skills reference](../../../skills.md#3-app-shipped-catalog).

## When to use

- You're researching a new MCP server or vendor integration and want the findings written up with sources before anyone commits to building.
- An engineer, product manager, or researcher needs a paper trail — what the connector would do, which connections it covers, and who approved it — before code lands.
- You want new connector work delivered under the playbooks and approval gates, not stitched together ad hoc.

### When not to use

- You're doing ad hoc connector coding that intentionally bypasses the playbooks — this skill exists to prevent that.
- There's no integration to research or deliver yet, just an open-ended question about a vendor.

## The two-phase flow

The skill keeps research and implementation strictly separate, with a human decision between them.

### Phase A — Research (no implementation)

Starting from the input link or vendor brief, Phase A produces a reviewable, cited **research pull request** in the `paperclip-content` repository. It gathers what the integration would involve and writes it up with its sources, so a person can read the findings and decide. No connector code is written in this phase.

### Human-approval gate

Phase B does not start on its own. A human has to explicitly accept **the exact research revision** — bound to a single pull-request head SHA — along with the specific set of connections to build. Approving one revision does not approve a later one; if the research changes, it needs approval again.

### Phase B — Implementation

Only after that approval does the skill implement the connector in the ThinkingMach app. It opens **one ThinkingMach app pull request per approved connection**, so each connection is reviewed and shipped on its own.

## The one-PR-per-connection rule

Every approved connection gets its own ThinkingMach app pull request. Connections are not bundled together — this keeps each one reviewable in isolation and makes it clear exactly what was approved and shipped for each.

## The secrets rule

Vendor credentials always live in approved secret storage — never anywhere else. They must not appear in briefs, catalog files, issue text, plans, logs, branch names, commits, or pull requests. If a credential is needed, it is referenced from secret storage, not pasted into any artifact the skill produces.
