# Tool Gateway

Your agents are good at deciding *what* to do. The **tool gateway** is what decides whether they are allowed to actually do it. It sits between an agent and every external tool you have connected — a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, a spreadsheet, an internal HTTP service — and brokers each call: it looks up who is asking, checks the tool-access policy, and then allows the call, blocks it, asks a human first, or defers it to a runtime that isn't ready yet. Everything it decides lands in an audit trail you can read back.

Around that broker sit the pieces you configure. **Applications** and **connections** are the things you connect to. A **catalog** is the list of tools a connection actually offers. A **profile** is a named bundle of "these tools are in scope", which you **bind** to a company, an agent, a project, a routine, an issue, or a gateway. **Policies** are the rules layered on top — block this, rate-limit that, ask a person before this one. And a **named MCP gateway** is a front door you can hand to an outside MCP client, so that client speaks plain MCP while ThinkingMach quietly applies all of the above.

Every route below is company-scoped, and company access is checked on every request. If you are new to the API, read the [API Overview](./overview.md) first for base URL, authentication, and error-code conventions; this page builds on those and won't repeat them.

> **Experimental — off by default.** The Tools, Profiles, and Apps surfaces are gated behind an instance experimental setting: an operator has to turn on `enableApps` before any of this appears in your instance. The Smoke Lab described near the end of this page is gated separately behind `enableSmokeLab`, and while that flag is off every Smoke Lab route responds `404 Not Found` with `{ "error": "Smoke lab is disabled" }`. Because the whole surface is experimental, treat the request and response shapes below as subject to change between releases.

## Permissions

Board callers need a permission key for the more sensitive routes. A local implicit board actor or an instance admin skips these checks; everyone else needs the key granted, or the request comes back `403 Forbidden` with `{ "error": "Missing permission: <key>" }`.

| Permission key | Covers |
|---|---|
| `tools:admin` | Creating, listing, and updating named MCP gateways; minting and revoking gateway tokens; managing approved stdio command templates. |
| `tools:manage_runtime` | Listing runtime slots, and stopping or restarting them. |
| `tools:view_audit` | Reading the gateway audit feed. |
| `tools:manage_connections` | Syncing a connection's installs. |
| `tools:use` | Running test calls against a connection (either this or `tools:manage_connections` is enough). |

Several routes that create or edit configuration don't use a permission key at all — instead they require an **active, non-viewer** company membership. A viewer gets `403 Forbidden` with `{ "error": "Viewer access is read-only" }`, and someone with no active membership gets `{ "error": "User does not have active company access" }`.

---

## The moving parts

### Applications and connections

An **application** is the thing you are connecting to, and a **connection** is one configured way of reaching it. An application has a `type` and a `status`; a connection has a `transport` — `remote_http` or `local_stdio` — plus its own `status` (`draft`, `active`, `disabled`, `archived`) and an `enabled` flag. A connection that is disabled, archived, or simply not `enabled` short-circuits every call through it with a denial (`deny_disabled_connection`), and the same is true one level up for an application that is `disabled` or `archived`.

### Catalog entries

Refreshing a connection pulls in its **catalog** — one entry per tool the connection offers, with the tool's `name`, `description`, `inputSchema`, and a `riskLevel`. Risk levels come from a fixed set: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`, `read`, `write`, `destructive`. Each entry also carries a `versionHash` and a `schemaHash`, which is how ThinkingMach notices that a tool you previously trusted has quietly changed shape.

### Profiles, entries, and bindings

A **profile** is a named set of tools, and it has a `defaultAction` of either `deny` or `allow`. Its **entries** narrow that down. Every entry has a `selectorType` — `application`, `connection`, `catalog_entry`, `tool_name`, or `risk_level` — and an `effect` of `include` or `exclude`.

A profile does nothing until you **bind** it. A binding has a `targetType` of `company`, `agent`, `project`, `routine`, `issue`, or `gateway`, and when several bindings match a single call, the narrowest scope wins.

### Policies

**Policies** are the rules evaluated on every call, in `priority` order (lower first). A policy has a `policyType`, a set of `selectors` that decide which calls it applies to, optional `conditions` that must also hold, and — for rate limits — a `config`.

The useful types are `allow`, `block`, `require_approval`, and `rate_limit`. Two others are special: `trust_rule` policies are managed only through the trust-rule promotion and revoke routes (trying to create one directly returns `422` with `Trust rules are managed through the trust-rule promotion and revoke endpoints`), and `redact` and `validate` are rejected outright with `Tool policy type '<type>' is not supported at runtime`.

A `rate_limit` policy needs a positive `limit` and `windowSeconds` in its `config`, or you get `422 Unprocessable Entity` with `Rate-limit policy config requires positive numeric limit and windowSeconds`. Its optional `keyBy` decides what the limit counts against; the default buckets by company, agent, connection, and tool.

Conditions come in named groups — `arguments`, `actor`, `context`, `risk`, `credentialScope`, `trustBoundary`, and `timeWindow` — and all of them must hold for the policy to apply. The `arguments` group supports `fieldEquals`, `fieldNotEquals`, `fieldIn`, `fieldMatches`, `fieldExists`, and `fieldAbsent`. A `fieldMatches` pattern that looks dangerous to evaluate is rejected up front with `Tool policy fieldMatches includes an unsafe regular expression`.

### What a decision looks like

Every brokered call ends in one of five decisions: `allow`, `deny`, `require_approval`, `rate_limited`, or `defer_runtime`. Alongside the decision you get a `reasonCode` (`deny_disabled_connection`, `allow_trust_rule`, `deny_policy_block`, and friends), a human-readable `explanation`, the `effectiveProfileIds` that were in play, and the `matchedPolicyIds` that fired.

## Named MCP Gateways

A named gateway is how you hand an outside MCP client — an editor, a desktop agent, another service — a single governed endpoint. The client authenticates with a bearer token you mint, asks for a tool list, and calls tools; ThinkingMach resolves the token to the gateway, applies the gateway's profile and your policies, and forwards only what is allowed.

### List gateways

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/gateways
```

Requires `tools:admin`. Returns `{ "gateways": [ ... ] }`.

### Create a gateway

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/gateways
```

Requires `tools:admin`. Responds `201 Created`.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | 1–160 characters, unique within the company. |
| `profileId` | yes | The tool profile this gateway serves. |
| `slug` / `displaySlug` | no | 1–120 characters each. |
| `description` | no | Up to 4,000 characters, or `null`. |
| `defaultProfileMode` | no | `gateway_only` (the default), `inherit_context_then_gateway`, or `gateway_then_context`. |
| `contextScopeType` | no | Defaults to `none`. |
| `contextScopeId` | no | 1–200 characters, or `null`. |
| `agentId`, `projectId`, `issueId`, `approvalIssueId` | no | UUIDs, or `null`. |
| `authConfig`, `headerPolicy`, `metadataPolicy`, `onDemandToolsConfig` | no | See below. |
| `metadata` | no | Arbitrary JSON object, or `null`. |

An invalid payload comes back `422 Unprocessable Entity` as `{ "error": "Invalid gateway payload", "issues": [ ... ] }`.

The four config blocks are where a gateway's manners live, and each has a sensible default:

- **`headerPolicy`** — whether caller headers pass through (`callerPassthrough`, off by default with an empty `allowedHeaders`), any `staticHeaders` you always attach, `generatedMetadata` headers, and which `responseHeaders` come back. By default it forwards MCP-required headers and safe cache headers.
- **`metadataPolicy`** — which identifiers ThinkingMach is allowed to tell the upstream tool about: `forwardCompanyId`, `forwardGatewayId`, `forwardProjectId`, `forwardIssueId`, `forwardAgentId`, `forwardRunId`, and `forwardCorrelationId`. Only `forwardCorrelationId` is on by default, so nothing about your company leaks unless you say so.
- **`authConfig`** — bearer-token behaviour. By default bearer auth is enabled with a `pcgw` token prefix, a 90-day default TTL, `requireFiniteExpiry` on, and `longLivedTokenRequiresOverride` on. OAuth is present but disabled.
- **`onDemandToolsConfig`** — off by default. When enabled it exposes two meta-tools, `search_tools` and `run_tool`, instead of a long static list, which keeps a large catalog from flooding the client's context.

### Update a gateway

```
PATCH /api/tool-gateway/gateways/{gatewayId}
```

Requires `tools:admin`. Send `companyId` in the body — without it you get `400 Bad Request` and `{ "error": "companyId is required" }`. Every create field is optional here, plus `status` (`draft`, `active`, `disabled`, `archived`). At least one field must be present.

### Mint a gateway token

```
POST /api/tool-gateway/gateways/{gatewayId}/tokens
```

Requires `tools:admin`, and `companyId` in the body. Responds `201 Created`.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | 1–160 characters. |
| `clientLabel` | yes | 1–160 characters — which client this token is for. |
| `ownerNote` | yes | 1–1,000 characters — who owns it and why it exists. |
| `subjectType` | no | Only `gateway_client` is accepted today. |
| `subjectId` | no | 1–240 characters, or `null`. |
| `allowedActions` | no | Any of `tools/list` and `tools/call`. Defaults to both. |
| `expiresAt` | no | A date, or `null` for a non-expiring token. |
| `expiryOverrideReason` | no | Required when `expiresAt` is `null`. |

Two rules are worth knowing before you script this. Asking for anything other than `gateway_client` as `subjectType` is rejected — `heartbeat_run` is runtime-managed, and `board_user` and `agent` are reserved for later OAuth and user-bound flows. And a token with no expiry is deliberately awkward: set `expiresAt` to `null` and you must also supply `expiryOverrideReason`, or you get `Non-expiring gateway tokens require an override reason`.

### Revoke a gateway token

```
POST /api/tool-gateway/gateway-tokens/{tokenId}/revoke
```

Requires `tools:admin`, and `companyId` in the body.

### The MCP endpoint itself

There are two ways to reach the same gateway — by its public id, or by its internal UUID:

```
GET  /mcp/gateways/{gatewayPublicId}
POST /mcp/gateways/{gatewayPublicId}
GET  /api/tool-gateway/gateways/{gatewayId}/mcp
POST /api/tool-gateway/gateways/{gatewayId}/mcp
```

The `GET` is a small discovery document telling a client how to connect:

```json
{
  "transport": "streamable_http",
  "endpoint": "/mcp/gateways/{gatewayPublicId}",
  "authentication": "bearer"
}
```

The `POST` speaks JSON-RPC. Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <gateway-token>`; without it you get `401 Unauthorized` and `{ "error": "Bearer token is required" }`.

| Method | What happens |
|---|---|
| `initialize` | Returns `protocolVersion` `2025-03-26`, a `capabilities` block advertising `tools`, and `serverInfo` naming `ThinkingMach MCP Gateway`. |
| `notifications/initialized` | Acknowledged with `202 Accepted` and no body. |
| `tools/list` | Returns the tools this gateway's profile allows, each with `name`, `title`, `description`, and `inputSchema`. |
| `tools/call` | Runs a tool. Takes `params.name` and `params.arguments`; a missing name is a JSON-RPC error `-32602` with `params.name is required`. |

Anything else returns `404` with JSON-RPC error `-32601`, `Method not found`. When a call is refused, the JSON-RPC `error` object carries a `data.reasonCode` so you can tell a policy block apart from a broken upstream.

---

## Agent Sessions

Named gateways are for outside clients. An agent working inside ThinkingMach uses a **session** instead: a short-lived token scoped to one agent and one run.

### Create a session

```
POST /api/tool-gateway/sessions
```

Board or agent callers. An agent's own `companyId`, `agentId`, and `runId` are taken from its token; a board caller supplies them in the body along with optional `issueId`, `projectId`, and `ttlMs`. Missing any of the three required ids gives `400 Bad Request` with `{ "error": "companyId, agentId, and runId are required" }`.

The `201 Created` response hands back everything the agent needs:

```json
{
  "sessionId": "...",
  "token": "...",
  "expiresAt": "2026-07-20T12:00:00.000Z",
  "toolsUrl": "/api/tool-gateway/tools",
  "callUrl": "/api/tool-gateway/tools/call"
}
```

### Revoke a session

```
POST /api/tool-gateway/sessions/{sessionId}/revoke
```

Returns `{ "sessionId": ..., "revokedAt": ... }`. An agent can only revoke its own sessions.

### List and call tools

```
GET  /api/tool-gateway/tools
POST /api/tool-gateway/tools/call
```

Both authenticate with the session token in the `x-paperclip-tool-gateway-token` header — not `Authorization`. Without it you get `401 Unauthorized` and `{ "error": "Tool gateway session token is required" }`.

The call body takes:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tool` | yes | The tool name. A missing or non-string value returns `400` with `"tool" is required and must be a string`. |
| `parameters` | no | The tool's arguments. Defaults to `{}`. |
| `timeoutMs` | no | How long to wait on the upstream tool. |
| `approvedActionRequestId` | no | The approval you are cashing in, when a previous attempt returned `require_approval`. |
| `idempotencyKey` | no | Makes a retry safe — the same key won't run the tool twice. |

---

## Approvals

When a policy says `require_approval`, the call becomes an **action request** rather than an immediate result. A human then decides.

```
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/action-requests
POST /api/tool-gateway/action-requests/{id}/approve
POST /api/tool-gateway/action-requests/{id}/decline
```

The list route takes a `status` query parameter and defaults to `pending`. Approve and decline both need `companyId`, either in the body or as a query parameter, and both require an active non-viewer membership.

Each action request stores a `canonicalArgumentsHash` and a redacted `canonicalArgumentsSummary`, so what a person approves is exactly what later runs — approving one call doesn't quietly bless a different set of arguments. Many requests also carry `previewMarkdown`, a readable summary of what the tool is about to do.

Once you have approved the same thing a few times, you can promote it into a standing rule:

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/action-requests/{actionRequestId}/trust-rule
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/trust-rules/{policyId}/revoke
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/trust-rules
```

A trust rule remembers the catalog `versionHash` and `schemaHash` it was created against. If the upstream tool is later quarantined, removed, or changes shape, the rule stops applying on its own and the call goes back to asking — trust is pinned to the tool you actually approved, not to its name.

---

## Redaction

ThinkingMach never stores raw tool arguments. Before anything is written to the audit trail, values are summarized and scrubbed: keys that look like secrets (`api_key`, `authorization`, `password`, `token`, `client_secret`, and similar) are replaced with `[REDACTED]`, and so are values matching known credential shapes. Long strings are truncated, and long arrays are capped. What you get back is a `redactionPlan` with a `redactedFieldCount` and the list of `redactedFields`, plus a hash you can compare across calls without ever seeing the values.

---

## Runtime Slots

A `local_stdio` connection runs a real process, and a **runtime slot** is ThinkingMach's handle on it — its status, health, last error, and idle deadline.

```
GET  /api/tool-gateway/runtime-slots?companyId={companyId}
POST /api/tool-gateway/runtime-slots/{slotId}/stop
POST /api/tool-gateway/runtime-slots/{slotId}/restart
```

All three require `tools:manage_runtime`. The same operations are also available under the company path:

```
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/runtime-slots
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/runtime-slots/{id}/stop
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/runtime-slots/{id}/restart
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/runtime-health
```

Because stdio connections launch commands, they are constrained by an approved list of **command templates**:

```
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/stdio-templates
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/stdio-templates
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/stdio-templates/{templateId}/disable
```

All three require `tools:admin`. A template pins a `command`, its `args`, the `envKeys` it may read, and the `tools` it provides — so a connection can only ever start something an admin has already vetted.

---

## The Audit Feed

```
GET /api/tool-gateway/audit?companyId={companyId}
```

Requires `tools:view_audit`. This is the record of everything the gateway did.

| Query parameter | Notes |
|---|---|
| `window` | `1h`, `24h`, `7d`, or `30d`. Defaults to `24h`. Anything else returns `400` with `window must be one of 1h, 24h, 7d, 30d`. |
| `limit` | 1–100. Defaults to `100`. |
| `app` | An `applicationId` or `connectionId` UUID. A non-UUID returns `400` with `app must be an applicationId or connectionId UUID`. |
| `agent` | An `agentId` UUID; likewise validated. |
| `outcome` | See the table below. |
| `search` | Free text, matched server-side against agent, app, and connection names as well as action names, tool names, and reason codes. |
| `cursor` | The `nextCursor` from a previous page. An unreadable cursor returns `400` with `Invalid audit cursor`. |

Each event carries a `normalizedOutcome` — a plain-language version of what happened, so you don't have to memorize the underlying action names:

| `normalizedOutcome` | Means |
|---|---|
| `allowed` | The call went through. |
| `asked_first` | An approval was requested before running. |
| `waiting` | The call was deferred, usually to a runtime that wasn't ready. |
| `blocked` | Policy or a rate limit stopped it. |
| `failed` | It ran and errored. |
| `unknown` | Doesn't map to any of the above. |

Events are also enriched for display with `agentDisplayName`, `appDisplayName`, `applicationDisplayName`, `connectionDisplayName`, and `toolDisplayName`. The response is `{ "events": [ ... ], "nextCursor": ... }`; page by feeding `nextCursor` back in until it comes back `null`.

The underlying actions, if you need them, are `tool_gateway.session_created`, `session_revoked`, `session_rejected`, `discovery`, `call_allowed`, `call_denied`, `call_completed`, `call_failed`, `call_deferred`, `approval_requested`, and `runtime_mcp_delivery`.

---

## Wiring up an App

The Apps surface is the friendly path to all of the above — pick something from a gallery, connect it, and let ThinkingMach generate a sensible profile and a set of ask-first rules for you.

```
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/gallery
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/apps/connect
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/apps/{connectionId}/finish
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/apps/attention
```

`connect` creates the application, the connection, and the catalog in one step, and responds `201 Created`. If the app authenticates with OAuth, the response's `auth` block comes back with a `startUrl` you send the person to. `finish` then decides `access` and, from it, builds the profile, its entries, its bindings, and the ask-first policies — the response tells you how many of each it made.

The `attention` route is the one to poll on a dashboard: it lists apps that need a human — a broken health check, an expired credential, newly appeared tools nobody has reviewed.

OAuth has its own two routes:

```
POST /api/tools/oauth/{connectionId}/start
GET  /api/tools/oauth/callback
```

These need a public base URL configured; without one you get `422 Unprocessable Entity` with `OAuth connections require THINKINGMACH_PUBLIC_URL or an auth public base URL`.

You can also start from a config file you already have:

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/mcp/import-json
```

This previews an MCP JSON config as a set of connection drafts. It only previews — nothing is created until you say so.

Examples are prebuilt, working setups you can install and smoke-test in place:

```
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/examples
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/examples/{id}/install
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/examples/{id}/smoke
```

---

## Managing Applications, Connections, and Profiles Directly

If you would rather build it yourself, every object has a plain CRUD surface.

Applications:

```
GET    /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/applications
POST   /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/applications
PATCH  /api/tool-applications/{applicationId}
DELETE /api/tool-applications/{applicationId}
```

Connections:

```
GET    /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/connections
POST   /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/connections
GET    /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}
PATCH  /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}
DELETE /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}
POST   /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/health-check
POST   /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/reconnect
POST   /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/catalog/refresh
GET    /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/catalog
GET    /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/activity
```

Deleting a connection archives it rather than dropping it, and if it was the last connection on its application, that application is archived too.

A connection can be **installed** onto a `company` or an `agent`, which is how you say who gets to see it at all:

```
GET /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/installs
PUT /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/installs
```

The `PUT` replaces the whole install set and requires `tools:manage_connections`.

Profiles, entries, and bindings:

```
GET    /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/profiles
POST   /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/profiles
PATCH  /api/tool-profiles/{profileId}
DELETE /api/tool-profiles/{profileId}
POST   /api/tool-profiles/{profileId}/duplicate
POST   /api/tool-profiles/{profileId}/entries
PATCH  /api/tool-profile-entries/{entryId}
DELETE /api/tool-profile-entries/{entryId}
POST   /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/profiles/{profileId}/bind
POST   /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/profiles/{profileId}/unbind
GET    /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/profiles/effective/agents/{agentId}
```

That last one answers the question you'll actually ask most often: *given everything I have configured, what can this agent really use?*

When a connection's catalog refresh turns up tools your profile has never seen, they are held back rather than silently allowed:

```
GET  /api/tool-profiles/{profileId}/new-tools
POST /api/tool-profiles/{profileId}/new-tools/review
```

Reviewing them returns an `allowedCount` and a `keptBlockedCount`, so an upstream server can't widen its own access just by adding a tool.

Policies:

```
GET    /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/policies
POST   /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/policies
PATCH  /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/policies/{policyId}
DELETE /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/policies/{policyId}
POST   /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/policies/{policyId}/duplicate
POST   /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/policies/reorder
```

Reordering rewrites `priority` in steps of 100 and must include **every** non-trust policy in the company — a partial list returns `422` with `Reorder must include every non-trust policy for the company`. A duplicated policy is always created **disabled**, so you can edit the copy before it starts affecting anything.

---

## Testing Before You Trust

Three routes let you rehearse a call without committing to it.

The dry run answers "what *would* happen":

```
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/policy/test
```

This runs the real decision engine over a hypothetical call and returns `{ "decision": ..., "auditEvent": ... }`. Nothing is executed. Set `writeAuditEvent` to `true` if you want the rehearsal recorded; otherwise `auditEvent` comes back `null`.

The live test actually runs the tool, as a chosen agent:

```
GET  /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/test-agents
POST /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/test-calls
GET  /api/tool-connections/{connectionId}/test-calls/{actionRequestId}
```

All three need `tools:use` or `tools:manage_connections`, and you can only test as an agent you would be allowed to assign work to. `test-agents` lists those agents along with each one's `effectiveAccess` for that connection. `test-calls` takes an `agentId`, a `toolName`, and optional `parameters`. If the call needs approval, you get an action request back and poll the third route for its status. When the gateway service isn't configured at all, these respond `501 Not Implemented` with `{ "error": "Tool gateway service is not configured" }`.

You can also look up how decisions landed for a specific agent run:

```
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/tools/runs/{runId}/decisions
```

---

## Smoke Lab

The Smoke Lab is a self-contained rehearsal environment: a fake OAuth provider and a set of loopback fixture services, so you can exercise the whole connect-authorize-call-audit path without touching a real vendor.

> **Gated twice.** Smoke Lab needs the `enableSmokeLab` experimental setting turned on, *and* it refuses to run on a publicly exposed instance. While it is off, every route here responds `404 Not Found` with `{ "error": "Smoke lab is disabled" }`.

```
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/services
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/services/start
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/services/stop
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/install-fixtures
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/reset
```

`install-fixtures` creates a ready-made application, connection, catalog, and profile, responding `201 Created` the first time and `200 OK` if they already exist. `reset` puts everything back.

Runs record what a rehearsal actually did:

```
GET   /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/runs
POST  /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/runs
GET   /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/runs/{runId}
PATCH /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/runs/{runId}
POST  /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/runs/{runId}/steps
```

A run has a `trigger` and a `status`; each recorded step has a `path` and a `status`, and both board users and agents can create runs and record steps — which is what lets an agent drive its own end-to-end check.

The lab's fake OAuth provider lives under the same prefix and behaves like a real one, so a connection you configure against it needs no special handling:

```
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/oauth/authorize
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/oauth/authorize
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/oauth/token
GET  /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/oauth/userinfo
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/smoke-lab/oauth/revoke
```

Redirect URIs are checked against the instance's own origin, so a fixture authorization code can never be handed to an outside host.

## Where to go next

- [API Overview](./overview.md) — base URL, authentication, company scoping, and the shared error-code table.
- [Company Skill Policy](./company-skill-policy.md) — the same guardrail idea applied to the skills your agents can pick up.
- [Agents](./agents.md) — the agents that profiles and gateway sessions are scoped to.
- [Secrets](./secrets.md) — where the credentials behind a connection are stored.
