# Secrets

Secrets are how ThinkingMach keeps sensitive values out of agent configs while still letting agents use them at runtime. The API is board-only and company-scoped.

Use this API when you need to:

- list the secrets stored for a company
- create a new secret value
- rotate a secret without changing how agents reference it
- write a new value through to a secret that lives in an external vault
- update secret metadata like the display name or description
- remove a secret entirely
- inspect which providers are available in this deployment

---

## Secret Providers

```http
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/secret-providers
```

Returns the providers available in this deployment.

The built-in provider is:

- `local_encrypted` - encrypted locally at rest

Other providers may appear in the list, but if they are not configured in the current deployment, they will reject create/resolve operations.

The provider descriptor includes:

- `id`
- `label`
- `requiresExternalRef`
- `supportsManagedValues`
- `supportsExternalReferences`
- `supportsExternalValueWrites`
- `configured`

If `requiresExternalRef` is `true`, the provider expects an external reference string in addition to the secret value.

The three `supports…` flags tell you what a provider will let you do, so you can check before you try:

- `supportsManagedValues` — ThinkingMach can create and rotate the value itself. The default `local_encrypted` provider reports `true` here and `false` for external references.
- `supportsExternalReferences` — the provider can link to a secret that already lives somewhere else, and ThinkingMach only stores the pointer.
- `supportsExternalValueWrites` — the interesting one. When this is `true`, you can also push a *new value* through to a linked external secret from ThinkingMach, instead of only repointing the link. `aws_secrets_manager` reports `true` here. The `gcp_secret_manager` and `vault` entries are placeholders in the current build: they report `supportsManagedValues: false` and never advertise external value writes.

`configured` tells you whether the provider has everything it needs in this deployment. A provider can advertise a capability and still be unconfigured, in which case the write fails when you attempt it.

See [Rotate Secret](#rotate-secret) for what happens when you use that last flag.

## What Is Stored

ThinkingMach stores secrets in two layers:

- `company_secrets` stores the secret record, metadata, and latest version pointer
- `company_secret_versions` stores the versioned material

For each secret, the API exposes metadata such as:

- `id`
- `companyId`
- `name`
- `provider`
- `managedMode`
- `externalRef`
- `latestVersion`
- `description`
- `createdByAgentId`
- `createdByUserId`
- `createdAt`
- `updatedAt`

What you do not get back is the plaintext secret value itself.

`managedMode` is worth understanding before you rotate anything, because it decides where the value actually lives:

- `paperclip_managed` — ThinkingMach owns the value. It created it, it stores it, and it writes the new one when you rotate.
- `external_reference` — the value lives in an external vault and `externalRef` is the pointer to it. ThinkingMach stores the pointer and a version history of that pointer, not the credential.

An `external_reference` secret used to be link-only. If the provider reports `supportsExternalValueWrites`, you can now also write a new value straight through to the external vault — see [Rotate Secret](#rotate-secret).

For the default `local_encrypted` provider, the stored version material is AES-GCM encrypted using the local master key. The version rows also keep a SHA-256 hash of the original value.

## List Secrets

```http
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/secrets
```

Returns the company secrets, newest first by creation time.

Use this when you want to see:

- which secrets exist
- which provider each secret uses
- what version is currently the latest
- whether a secret has a description or external reference

The secret values themselves are never returned.

## Secret Catalog

```http
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/secrets/catalog
```

Returns a trimmed list of the company's secrets — just the `id`, `name`, `key`, and `status` of each. Unlike [List Secrets](#list-secrets), which is board-only and returns full metadata, the catalog is meant for picking a secret to reference, so it's callable by the board *or* by an agent with access to the company. The secret values themselves are never returned.

Use this when you want to show which secrets are available to bind — for example, populating a picker in an agent config — without exposing provider details or version history.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3100/api/companies/company-1/secrets/catalog" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

---

## Create Secret

```http
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/secrets
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | Unique within the company. |
| `value` | Yes | The plaintext secret value to store. |
| `provider` | No | Defaults to `local_encrypted`. |
| `description` | No | Human-readable note for operators. |
| `externalRef` | No | Required by some external providers. |

If you omit `provider`, ThinkingMach uses the deployment default provider if it is valid, otherwise it falls back to `local_encrypted`.

The value is stored as a new version immediately:

- version `1` is created
- `latestVersion` is set to `1`
- the API returns the secret metadata, not the plaintext

If another secret already exists with the same `name` in the same company, the API returns a conflict.

## Update Secret

```http
PATCH /api/secrets/{secretId}
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | No | Rename the secret. Must still be unique within the company. |
| `description` | No | Update the operator-facing note. |
| `externalRef` | No | Update the provider reference without creating a new secret version. |

This endpoint does not change the secret value. There is no `value` field here, and that has not changed — every value write, including a write through to an external vault, goes through [Rotate Secret](#rotate-secret).

Use it when you want to tidy up metadata or point an external-backed secret at a new provider reference without changing how the secret is versioned in ThinkingMach.

    },
    json={
        "name": "anthropic-api-key-prod",
        "description": "Production Claude key",
    },

```

## Rotate Secret

```http
POST /api/secrets/{secretId}/rotate
Content-Type: application/json
```

Body:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `value` | Yes for `paperclip_managed` | The new plaintext secret value. Optional on an `external_reference` secret — send it only when you want to write the new value through to the external vault. |
| `externalRef` | No | If omitted, ThinkingMach keeps the existing external reference for the secret. |
| `providerVersionRef` | No | Pins an `external_reference` secret at a specific provider-side version when you repoint it. It cannot be combined with a `value`, and it has no effect on a `paperclip_managed` secret. |
| `providerConfigId` | No | Pins the write to a specific provider vault. Omit it to keep the vault the secret already uses; send `null` to fall back to the deployment default. |

Rotation creates a new immutable version and advances `latestVersion`.

Important behavior:

- the secret ID stays the same
- existing references using `version: "latest"` automatically pick up the new value
- references pinned to a numeric version keep using that version
- the old versions remain in storage as version history

This is the endpoint to use when the credential changes but the secret identity stays the same.

### Rotating an external-reference secret

The examples above are the `paperclip_managed` case, where rotation always means "store this new value". For an `external_reference` secret there are two different things you might want, and the request body is what picks between them.

**Repoint the link.** Send `externalRef` (and optionally `providerVersionRef`) with no `value`. ThinkingMach records a new metadata version pointing at a different secret in the vault. Nothing is written to the vault itself — this is the behavior external-reference secrets have always had.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3100/api/secrets/secret-uuid/rotate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <board-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "externalRef": "prod/anthropic/api-key"
  }'
```

**Write a new value through.** Send `value` and leave the reference alone — the same request shape as the tabs above. If the provider supports it, ThinkingMach writes that value into the external secret your `externalRef` already points at. You no longer have to leave ThinkingMach, open the vault console, and paste the credential there by hand.

This second option only works when the provider actually implements external value writes; such a provider advertises `supportsExternalValueWrites` in its descriptor, which is what the board reads to decide whether to offer you the choice. Today that means AWS Secrets Manager.

What that write looks like on the AWS side:

- ThinkingMach reads the current `AWSCURRENT` version first, so it knows what it is replacing.
- It then writes the new value as a new AWS version, which becomes `AWSCURRENT`. That is deliberate: **every** consumer of that AWS secret picks up the new value, not just ThinkingMach.
- The stored material keeps tracking `AWSCURRENT` rather than pinning the version it just wrote, so a later rotation done directly in AWS still flows through to ThinkingMach.
- If ThinkingMach fails to record the new version after the vault write succeeded, it moves `AWSCURRENT` back to the version that was current before, so you are not left with a value the control plane doesn't know about.

Because the write goes to a shared vault, treat it as a real rotation: anything else reading that AWS secret sees the new value on its next read.

On success you get the same response as any other rotation — the updated secret record, with `latestVersion` advanced, `lastRotatedAt` stamped, and `externalRef` set to the reference the provider confirmed. AWS normalizes that to the full ARN of the secret it wrote to, so the value you get back may be more specific than the one you sent when the secret was linked.

If you would rather do this from the board, [Connect an AWS Secrets Manager vault](../../how-to/connect-aws-secrets-vault.md#change-the-value-of-a-linked-aws-secret) walks through the same two choices in the UI.

### Validation errors for external value writes

A value write to an external-reference secret is rejected before anything reaches the provider when:

| Condition | Message |
|---|---|
| The secret has no `externalRef` to write to. | `External reference secrets require externalRef` |
| You sent both a new `value` and a different `externalRef`. | `Provide either a new value or a new external reference, not both` |
| You sent a `value` together with `providerVersionRef`. | `Value updates cannot pin providerVersionRef` |
| The provider cannot write values to external secrets. | `<provider label> does not support writing values to external reference secrets` |

The last message embeds the provider's own label — so a refusal from the GCP Secret Manager stub reads `GCP Secret Manager does not support writing values to external reference secrets`. You will not see this one from AWS Secrets Manager, which implements the write.

There is a fifth rejection that comes from AWS itself rather than the shared validation above: writing to a reference that points inside the vault's ThinkingMach-managed namespace fails with `AWS ThinkingMach-managed namespace secrets cannot be imported as external references`. Those secrets are ThinkingMach's own to rotate — link to a secret you manage instead.

The rule behind the second and third rows is the same one: one request does one thing. Repointing the link and replacing the value are separate rotations, so run them as separate calls if you need both.

---

## Delete Secret

```http
DELETE /api/secrets/{secretId}
```

Deletes the secret and its version history.

This is a hard delete at the API layer:

- the secret row is removed
- the version rows cascade away with it
- future runtime resolution will fail for any configs still pointing at that secret

Delete only when you are sure nothing should resolve that secret anymore.

---

## Using Secrets In Agent Config

Agent adapter configs can reference secrets in `env` instead of storing inline plaintext.

The supported binding format is:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": {
      "type": "secret_ref",
      "secretId": "secret-uuid",
      "version": "latest"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also pin to a numeric version:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": {
      "type": "secret_ref",
      "secretId": "secret-uuid",
      "version": 2
    }
  }
}
```

What happens at runtime:

- ThinkingMach validates that the secret belongs to the same company
- it resolves the requested version
- it decrypts or fetches the underlying value through the provider
- it injects the plaintext into the agent process environment

Versioning rules:

- `version: "latest"` tracks future rotations automatically
- a numeric version stays pinned to that exact historical value
- if you omit `version`, ThinkingMach treats it as `latest`

Sensitive inline values are still accepted in some configs for backward compatibility, but the secret reference form is the preferred pattern for anything sensitive.

> **Tip:** Use `version: "latest"` for credentials you expect to rotate. Use a pinned numeric version only when you need the agent to keep using a known historical value.

## Delivery modes: env vs access

There is more than one way for a secret to reach an agent, and the difference matters when you care about how long a value sits in memory.

- **Environment injection (`env`)** is the classic path described above. ThinkingMach resolves the secret at launch and injects the plaintext into the agent process environment. The value is present for the whole run.
- **Run-bound access (`api`)** exposes the secret through an API the running agent calls on demand, instead of pre-loading it into the environment. Nothing is injected up front; the agent fetches the value only when it needs it.
- **`both`** means the same secret is available through environment injection *and* the run-bound access API.

When you list an agent's granted secrets (see below), each entry reports its `delivery` as `env`, `api`, or `both`, so an agent can tell how a given credential will be delivered before it reaches for it.

Access-mode grants are the ones marked as API-only. Operators manage which secrets each agent can reach — and whether a grant is delivered as an environment variable or as run-bound access — from the **Secret access** editor in agent settings. The deep folder and picker UI for that editor is documented in [Secret folders](../../administration/secret-folders.md).

## Run-Bound Agent Secret Access

These two routes let a running agent read the secrets it has been granted, on demand, rather than relying only on values injected at launch. They are agent-only and run-bound: the caller must authenticate as an agent whose token is backed by a live, verified heartbeat run, and every request is evaluated through the `secrets:read` authorization check.

Low-trust tokens stay denied here on purpose — skill-test run tokens and low-trust review agents cannot use this API, so it never broadens what those restricted runs can reach.

### List granted secrets

```http
GET /api/agents/me/secrets
```

Returns just the aliases this agent is granted — never the secret values. The response is `{ "secrets": [...] }`, where each entry carries `key`, `name`, `description`, `delivery`, `projectionClass`, `latestVersion`, `versionSelector`, and `resolvedVersion`. The internal secret ID, binding ID, and config path are stripped from the payload.

Use the `key` from each entry as the alias for the value route below.

### Read one secret value

```http
POST /api/agents/me/secrets/{key}/value
```

Returns the plaintext value for a single granted alias. The `{key}` path parameter is the `key` from the list route. The response body is `{ "key", "value", "version" }`, and it is returned with a `Cache-Control: no-store` header so the value is not retained by caches or intermediaries.

If the alias is not granted to the calling agent, the request is rejected with a forbidden error. Every successful value read is written to both the security audit trail and the operator activity log, so each fetch is tied to a specific agent and run.

Full request and response examples for both routes live on the [Agents reference](agents.md#fetch-granted-secrets) page, since they are agent-run-scoped.

## Secret proposals

Secrets and their bindings are board-only to create — but the agent doing the work is often the one who first knows a credential is missing. Secret proposals close that gap. A running agent can *propose* the secret it needs, or *propose a binding* that wires an existing secret into an agent's config, and then a person on the board approves, rejects, or lets it expire. The agent never gets to create the secret itself; it only asks.

> **Agents propose, people decide.** An agent can raise a proposal and watch its status, but only a board member can approve it. Approval is the moment the secret is actually created or the binding is actually applied — nothing sensitive changes on the strength of a proposal alone.

There are two kinds of proposal, and the `kind` field picks between them:

- `secret` — "please create this company secret." The agent supplies a name, a value, and a justification. On approval the board creates a real company secret from the proposed value.
- `binding` — "please wire a secret into an agent's config." The agent points at an existing secret (`secretId`) or at another pending secret proposal (`secretProposalId`), and names the `configPath` to bind it to. On approval the board writes a `secret_ref` into the target agent's adapter config.

A binding can depend on a secret proposal that hasn't been approved yet, so an agent can raise both in one go: propose the secret, then propose a binding that references the secret proposal by ID. The board can approve them together (see [Approve a proposal](#approve-a-proposal)).

### Who can propose

The agent-side routes require a **verified run-bound agent token** — the same live-heartbeat requirement as [Run-Bound Agent Secret Access](#run-bound-agent-secret-access), plus a real signed agent JWT. Task-bridge and skill-test tokens are refused, and the run is checked against the `secrets:propose` authorization action.

```json
403 Forbidden
{ "error": "Secret proposals require a verified run-bound agent token" }
```

### Propose a secret or binding

```http
POST /api/agents/me/secret-proposals
Content-Type: application/json
```

The body is discriminated by `kind`.

**Proposing a `secret`:**

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | Yes | `"secret"`. |
| `name` | Yes | A slash-separated path with no empty segments, e.g. `anthropic/api-key`. |
| `value` | Yes | The plaintext value. At most `65536` bytes. It is encrypted immediately and registered for run-log redaction. |
| `justification` | Yes | Why the agent needs it. Shown to the board. |
| `key` | No | The environment-style key. Defaults to the last segment of `name`, normalised. |
| `description` | No | Operator-facing note carried onto the created secret. |

**Proposing a `binding`:**

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | Yes | `"binding"`. |
| `configPath` | Yes | Where to bind it. Must be `env.<KEY>` or `access.<ALIAS>`. |
| `secretId` | One of | An existing active company secret to bind. |
| `secretProposalId` | One of | A still-pending `secret` proposal to bind once it's approved. Send exactly one of `secretId` or `secretProposalId`. |
| `targetAgentId` | No | The agent to bind onto. Defaults to the proposing agent, and may only be the proposer itself or one of its reports. |
| `justification` | Yes | Why the binding is needed. |

The binding target policy is fixed server-side to `self_and_reports`: an agent can bind onto itself or an agent below it in the chain of command, and nothing higher. A target outside that chain is rejected:

```json
403 Forbidden
{ "error": "Binding proposals may target only the proposing agent or its reports" }
```

On success you get `201 Created` with the proposal record (see [Proposal fields](#proposal-fields)). The proposed value is never echoed back — the agent-facing view strips the value fingerprint and length as well.

    "configPath": "env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
    "justification": "Wire the shared key into my runtime"
  }'
```

There are guardrails on how fast and how many an agent can raise. An agent may hold at most `20` pending proposals and create at most `20` per minute; crossing either line returns `422`:

```json
422 Unprocessable Entity
{ "error": "Agents may have at most 20 pending secret proposals" }
```

### List your proposals

```http
GET /api/agents/me/secret-proposals
```

Returns the proposals this agent raised, plus any `binding` proposals that target this agent, newest first. Values are never included.

The response wraps the rows and echoes the next page offset:

```json
{
  "proposals": [ /* proposal records */ ],
  "nextOffset": 100
}
```

Pagination is by `limit` (default `100`, capped at `200`) and `offset` query parameters. The same paging is also reported in `X-Page-Limit`, `X-Page-Offset`, and — when there's more to fetch — `X-Next-Offset` response headers. `nextOffset` is `null` on the last page. A non-numeric `limit` or `offset` is rejected with `422` (`limit must be a positive integer` / `offset must be a non-negative integer`).

### Withdraw a proposal

```http
DELETE /api/agents/me/secret-proposals/{id}
```

The agent that raised a proposal can withdraw it while it is still pending. Withdrawing moves it to status `withdrawn`, scrubs the stored ciphertext, and — if it was a `secret` proposal — cascades any pending `binding` proposals that depended on it to `rejected`.

Only the original proposer may withdraw, and only a pending proposal can be resolved:

```json
403 Forbidden
{ "error": "Only the proposer can withdraw this proposal" }
```

```json
409 Conflict
{ "error": "Only pending proposals can be resolved" }
```

### Review proposals

```http
GET /api/companies/{companyId}/secret-proposals
```

The same list is what the board sees under **Company settings → Secrets → Proposals**, where the tab carries a count badge while anything is pending:

![The Proposals tab in company secrets settings: one pending proposal showing its path-style name, the proposing agent, the value's fingerprint and byte length, its expiry, the agent's stated reason, and Approve and Reject buttons](../../user-guides/screenshots/light/secrets/proposals-tab.png)

The board-side list. Returns proposals for the company, newest first, as a plain array (not wrapped). Add `?status=` to filter by one of `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `withdrawn`, or `expired`. It takes the same `limit`/`offset` paging and the same `X-Page-*` headers as the agent list.

Each row is enriched for review: alongside the proposal fields it carries `proposedBy`, the `target` agent (for bindings), the `originIssue` it came from, and the resolved names of any referenced secret (`secretName`) or prerequisite secret proposal (`secretProposalName`). It also carries two review hints:

- `viewerCanApprove` — whether *you*, the calling board member, are allowed to approve this one.
- `approveBlockReason` — when you can't, a short reason why; `null` when you can.

For a `secret` proposal, approving requires company admin access, so a non-admin board member sees:

```json
{
  "viewerCanApprove": false,
  "approveBlockReason": "Company admin access required"
}
```

For a `binding` proposal, approval is gated on your permission to change the *target agent's* config (an `agent_config:update` change grant), so the block reason mirrors that authorization decision. Any proposal that is no longer pending reports `viewerCanApprove: false` with `approveBlockReason: "Proposal is no longer pending"`.

### Approve a proposal

```http
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/secret-proposals/{id}/approve
Content-Type: application/json
```

Approval is where the proposal takes effect. For a `secret` proposal, the board creates a real company secret from the proposed value and records its ID as `createdSecretId`. For a `binding` proposal, the board writes a `secret_ref` into the target agent's adapter config at the proposed `configPath` and records it as `appliedBindingConfigPath`. Either way the proposal moves to `approved`, the stored ciphertext is scrubbed, and `resolvedByUserId`/`resolvedAt` are stamped.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cascade` | No | When a binding depends on a still-pending `secret` proposal, `cascade: true` approves that prerequisite in the same transaction and binds the secret it creates. |
| `overrides.name` | No | Rename the created secret at approval time. |
| `overrides.description` | No | Override the description on the created secret. |
| `overrides.providerConfigId` | No | Store the created secret in a specific provider vault instead of `local_encrypted`. |

Who is allowed to approve depends on the kind, exactly as `viewerCanApprove` advertises: a `secret` proposal needs company admin access, and a `binding` proposal needs change-grant permission on the target agent.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3100/api/companies/company-1/secret-proposals/proposal-uuid/approve" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <board-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

Approval fails safely if the situation has shifted since the proposal was raised. A proposal past its expiry can't be approved (`Expired proposals cannot be approved`), a binding whose prerequisite is still pending needs the cascade flag (`Binding proposal requires pending secret proposal <id>; retry with cascade=true`), and a binding whose target has since moved out of the proposer's chain of command is refused (`Binding proposal target is no longer allowed by its proposal-time and current chain-of-command policy`). These come back as `409 Conflict`.

### Reject a proposal

```http
POST /api/companies/{companyId}/secret-proposals/{id}/reject
Content-Type: application/json
```

Rejecting moves the proposal to `rejected`, scrubs the ciphertext, and records the reason. A reason is required:

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `reason` | Yes | Non-empty. Stored on the proposal and shown back to the origin issue. |

Rejecting a `secret` proposal also cascades any pending `binding` proposals that depended on it to `rejected`, so a declined secret can't leave dangling bindings behind.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3100/api/companies/company-1/secret-proposals/proposal-uuid/reject" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <board-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "reason": "Use the shared vault key instead" }'
```

An empty reason is rejected with `422`:

```json
422 Unprocessable Entity
{ "error": "Rejection reason is required" }
```

### When a proposal resolves

Proposals usually start life inside a piece of work. When a proposal is raised, ThinkingMach resolves the issue behind the current run — the issue whose execution or checkout run matches — and stores it as `originIssueId`.

That link pays off when the board decides. On approval or rejection, if the proposal has an `originIssueId`, ThinkingMach posts a resolution comment back onto that issue and wakes the assignment so the agent picks the outcome up. The comment names the proposal and its new status, for example:

```
Secret proposal resolution

- Proposal: secret proposal `anthropic/api-key`
- Status: **approved**
```

A rejection appends the reason. The notification is best-effort: if the comment or wakeup fails it is logged and the resolution still stands.

### Statuses and expiry

A proposal's `status` is always one of:

- `pending` — awaiting a decision. The only state that can be approved, rejected, or withdrawn.
- `approved` — the secret was created or the binding applied.
- `rejected` — declined by the board, or cascaded from a rejected prerequisite.
- `withdrawn` — pulled by the proposing agent.
- `expired` — a pending proposal aged out. Proposals expire `14` days after they are raised, and a background sweep transitions them to `expired`.

Whenever a proposal leaves `pending`, the encrypted value is scrubbed and `ciphertextScrubbedAt` is stamped — an approved secret keeps living as a real company secret, and nothing sensitive lingers on the proposal record.

### Proposal fields

Every proposal record carries the same shape; unused fields are `null` for the kind that doesn't use them. A `secret` proposal seen through the agent view looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "proposal-uuid",
  "companyId": "company-1",
  "kind": "secret",
  "status": "pending",
  "proposedName": "anthropic/api-key",
  "proposedKey": "API_KEY",
  "proposedDescription": "Key the billing agent needs",
  "justification": "Needed to call the Anthropic API for this issue",
  "secretId": null,
  "secretProposalId": null,
  "targetType": null,
  "targetId": null,
  "configPath": null,
  "projectionClass": "unclassified",
  "proposedByAgentId": "agent-uuid",
  "originIssueId": "issue-uuid",
  "originRunId": "run-uuid",
  "resolvedByUserId": null,
  "resolvedAt": null,
  "resolutionReason": null,
  "createdSecretId": null,
  "appliedBindingConfigPath": null,
  "ciphertextScrubbedAt": null,
  "expiresAt": "2026-09-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "createdAt": "2026-08-18T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-08-18T12:00:00.000Z",
  "secretName": null,
  "secretProposalName": null,
  "proposedBy": { "id": "agent-uuid", "name": "Billing", "icon": "…" },
  "target": null,
  "originIssue": { "id": "issue-uuid", "key": "PC-42", "title": "Wire up billing" }
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `id` | The proposal ID. |
| `companyId` | Owning company. |
| `kind` | `secret` or `binding`. |
| `status` | One of the statuses above. |
| `proposedName` / `proposedKey` / `proposedDescription` | The requested secret's name, key, and note. Set only for `secret` proposals. |
| `justification` | The agent's stated reason. |
| `secretId` | For a `binding` on an existing secret. |
| `secretProposalId` | For a `binding` on a still-pending secret proposal. |
| `targetType` / `targetId` / `configPath` | The bind target: `agent`, the agent ID, and the `env.<KEY>` / `access.<ALIAS>` path. Set only for `binding` proposals. |
| `originIssueId` / `originRunId` | The issue and run the proposal came from. |
| `resolvedByUserId` / `resolvedAt` / `resolutionReason` | Who resolved it, when, and why (rejections). |
| `createdSecretId` | The company secret created when a `secret` proposal is approved. |
| `appliedBindingConfigPath` | The path written when a `binding` proposal is approved. |
| `ciphertextScrubbedAt` | When the stored value was wiped (any non-pending proposal). |
| `expiresAt` / `createdAt` / `updatedAt` | Lifecycle timestamps. |
| `secretName` / `secretProposalName` | Resolved display names for the referenced secret or prerequisite proposal. |
| `proposedBy` / `target` / `originIssue` | Enriched summaries of the proposing agent, the target agent, and the origin issue. |

The board view adds `viewerCanApprove` and `approveBlockReason`, and — unlike the agent view — keeps `valueFingerprintSha256` and `valueLength` so reviewers can sanity-check a proposed value without ever seeing it. The raw ciphertext and the chain-of-command snapshots are never returned to either audience.

## `secret-ref` form fields

Some configs aren't typed by hand — they're driven by a JSON schema the server publishes, and the UI renders the form from that schema. Whenever a string field in such a schema declares `"format": "secret-ref"`, the UI swaps the plain text input for a secret binding picker.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "githubToken": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "secret-ref",
      "title": "GitHub token"
    }
  }
}
```

What you get on screen:

- a dropdown listing the active secrets for the current company
- a "paste a raw value" fallback for cases where you don't have a secret stored yet
- the picker recognises a UUID-shaped value as a bound secret reference; anything else is a raw value that ThinkingMach stores as a new secret on save

This is the same picker used by routine `env` values, agent adapter env, and any other config surface that opts in via `format: "secret-ref"`. If you're authoring a plugin or adapter schema, mark the sensitive fields with that format and the binding UI comes along for free.

See [Routine env map](../../how-to/create-a-daily-routine.md#4-optional-give-the-routine-an-env-map) for the routine-side example.

## Practical Notes

- The secret name must be unique within the company.
- Create uses version `1`; rotate increments the version counter.
- `update` changes metadata only, not the stored value.
- `rotate` creates a new stored value and updates the latest pointer.
- On an `external_reference` secret, `rotate` either repoints the link or — when the provider advertises `supportsExternalValueWrites` — writes the new value through to the external vault. It will not do both in one request.
- `local_encrypted` is the default provider in a normal local deployment.
- External providers are advertised by `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/secret-providers`, but only the configured provider actually works in the current deployment.
- The API is board-only and company-scoped throughout.
