# Documentation Changelog

What changed in **these docs** — pages added, rewritten, or expanded — with each documentation update. This is a changelog for the documentation itself, not for ThinkingMach the product.

The docs track ThinkingMach's [calendar-versioned](https://github.com/thinkingmach/paperclip/releases) releases (`YYYY.MDD.P`), so each entry is tagged with the ThinkingMach release the docs were brought in line with. For the product's own release notes — the actual feature and fix history — see the [ThinkingMach releases page](https://github.com/thinkingmach/paperclip/releases). To update your install, see [Update ThinkingMach](../how-to/update-paperclip.md).

<summary>Docs for v2026.831.1 <span class="accordion-meta">September 2, 2026</span></summary>
<div class="accordion-body">

**New pages**

- [Kimi Code Adapter](adapters/kimi-local.md) — how to run Moonshot's Kimi Code CLI (`kimi_local`) as a local agent: the shared ACP engine with headless-CLI fallback, models and thinking-effort tiers, session resume, skills injection, and the three ways it authenticates.

**Updated pages**

- [Adapters Overview](adapters/overview.md) — Kimi Code added to the built-in adapter tables and the ACP engine tier.
- [Environment Variables](deploy/environment-variables.md) — new deployment settings: `THINKINGMACH_WORKSPACE_REAPER_COOLDOWN_DAYS` (how long a terminal workspace waits before it's archived), opt-in Sentry error monitoring via `SENTRY_DSN`, and the operator controls `THINKINGMACH_HIDDEN_SETTINGS` and `THINKINGMACH_SETTING_DEFAULTS`.
- [Instance Settings](../administration/settings.md) — a new section for operators hosting ThinkingMach for others: hiding settings surfaces by key and overriding setting defaults, neither of which is ever persisted.
- [Company Administration](../administration/company.md), [Members & Access](../guides/org/members-and-access.md), and [Roles & Permissions](../administration/roles-and-permissions.md) — settings are now one shared navigation, Invites moved into a tab of the Members page, and the company brand color and per-company attachment size limit were removed.
- [Grok Local Adapter](adapters/grok-local.md) — `permissionMode` no longer defaults to `dontAsk`; when unset no permission-mode flag is passed, and `--always-approve` is the unattended policy.
- [First company](../guides/getting-started/your-first-company.md) and the [five-minute path](../guides/getting-started/five-minute-path.md) — onboarding is rebuilt around a single-card wizard that opens on creating your agent; the separate mission step is gone and you set the goal afterward.
- [Task Watchdogs](../guides/projects-workflow/task-watchdogs.md), [Auto-Create Recovery Tasks](../experimental/auto-create-recovery-tasks.md), and [Issues](../guides/day-to-day/issues.md) — silent-run detection now only surfaces a UI level rather than creating issues, comments, or wakes; stranded-task recovery hands off to a board-owned action instead of taking work over; and automatic run-summary comments carry only the final output, never agent thinking.
- [Authentication API](api/authentication.md) — an invalid agent token now returns a `401` naming the cause instead of falling through to an anonymous actor.
- [Companies API](api/companies.md) and [Cases API](api/cases.md) — `brandColor` removed from the company shape and branding routes; the attachment cap is the deployment-level `THINKINGMACH_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES`, not a per-company field.
- The CLI [installation](cli/installation.md) and [setup](cli/setup-commands.md) pages, [local development](deploy/local-development.md), the [Modal adapter](adapters/modal.md), and several guides now state the raised **Node.js 24.11.0** floor.

<div class="accordion-body">

**Updated pages**

- [CLI Setup Commands](cli/setup-commands.md) — after `onboard` installs the background service, it now hands you off to the running instance: it waits for the port the service actually bound, prints the dashboard URL, and opens it in your browser. Headless runs print the URL, and `THINKINGMACH_NO_BROWSER=1` opts out of the browser launch.

<div class="accordion-body">

**New pages**

- [Tailscale HTTPS Broker](deploy/tailscale-https-broker.md) — the operator-side helper that hands out real, cert-valid `https://` preview URLs for the dev servers running inside managed workspaces, instead of loopback-only links.

**Updated pages**

- [Workspaces](../guides/projects-workflow/workspaces.md) — exposing a workspace's dev server as an HTTPS preview on your tailnet, opt-in per service, and what that looks like from the board.
- [Update ThinkingMach](../how-to/update-paperclip.md) and [CLI installation](cli/installation.md) — the four release channels (`stable`, `beta`, `nightly`, `canary`) and the new `thinkingmach channels` command that shows which one your install follows.
- [Export & Import](../guides/power/export-import.md) — large packages now upload in resumable parts, so an interrupted import picks up from the parts it already has instead of starting over.
- [Companies API](api/companies.md) — the chunked import-transfer routes (`/api/companies/import/transfers`) that back resumable imports.
- [Secrets API](api/secrets.md) — the agent-callable secret catalog route for picking a secret to reference without exposing full metadata.
- [Agents API](api/agents.md) — the Claude subscription (setup-token) login flow: a company owner can log Claude in with a subscription instead of pasting an API key.
- [Adapters API](api/adapters.md) — the adapter device-login routes (code-and-URL browser sign-in), starting with Codex.
- [Artifacts](../guides/day-to-day/artifacts.md) — inline, Google-Docs-style comments on Plan and Artifact documents: anchored highlights, threaded replies, resolve/reopen, and shareable comment links.
- [Issues](../guides/day-to-day/issues.md) and [Attention API](api/attention.md) — who may resolve an interaction card (`anyone`, `not_creator`, `human_only`) and company-wide interaction governance.
- [Issues API](api/issues.md) — the workspace file-resource availability check.
- Smaller touch-ups brought in line with the release: [Environment Variables](deploy/environment-variables.md) (workspace Git-scan limits) and [Decisions](../guides/day-to-day/decisions.md).

<details class="accordion">
<summary>Docs for v2026.817.0 <span class="accordion-meta">August 17, 2026</span></summary>
<div class="accordion-body">

**New pages**

- [Decisions API](api/decisions.md) — proposing and resolving decisions, decision bundles, named queues, triage (decide-by and snooze), and the retention/archive routes.
- [Status Cards API](api/status-cards.md) — the shared status-card board: creating cards, the compiled query, summary writes and revisions, refresh policy, and the agent-authoring limits.
- [Status Cards](../experimental/status-cards.md) — the experimental board itself: writing the one message that drives a card, reading the tiles, the five card states, what counts as a change, and what it costs.
- [Chat-Style Tasks](../experimental/task-chat.md) — the experimental task page as a live conversation: bubbles, folding turns, inline tool calls and diffs, the three-mode composer, and the resizable side pane.
- [`service` CLI](cli/service.md) — installing, starting, and inspecting ThinkingMach as a background service.
- [Status Card Query skill](skills/bundled/paperclip-operations/status-card-query.md) — the bundled skill that teaches an agent to manage status cards.
- [Simplified English skill](skills/optional/content/simplified-english.md) and [Prepare MCP Integration skill](skills/optional/software-development/prepare-mcp-integration.md) — two new optional catalog skills.

**Updated pages**

- [Decisions](../guides/day-to-day/decisions.md) — named queues, triage deadlines, and answering an agent-proposed decision, now with screenshots throughout.
- [Secrets API](api/secrets.md) — agent secret proposals: what an agent may propose, the run-bound agent-token requirement, and the board-side approve/reject flow.
- [Activity Log API](api/activity.md) — the audit feed of agent actions, its two-tier access model, and CSV export. `/audit` has merged into the single Activity page.
- [Plugin SDK](plugins/sdk.md) — responding to interactions and approvals, and the rules for handling adapter-authored `command` operations and re-validating `cwd` before executing.
- [Back up and restore a company](../how-to/back-up-and-restore-a-company.md) — what the bundle deliberately leaves behind, uploading the zip instead of inline JSON, and running large imports as a background job.
- [Update ThinkingMach](../how-to/update-paperclip.md) — rewritten around checking before you commit, switching channels, rolling back, and the pre-update backup.
- [Cloud CLI](cli/cloud.md) — the cloud-upstream commands are retired; the page now points at what replaced them.
- [Issues API](api/issues.md), [Attention API](api/attention.md), [Environment Variables](deploy/environment-variables.md), [CLI installation](cli/installation.md), [Export & import](../guides/power/export-import.md), [Sandbox providers](adapters/sandbox-providers.md), [Skills reference](skills.md), and [Issues](../guides/day-to-day/issues.md) — brought in line with the release.

**Screenshots**

- Every screenshot was recaptured against v2026.817.0 — 342 images, light and dark. The previous set was 375 parent-commits old.
- New coverage for Decisions, Status Cards, Chat-Style Tasks, and the secret-proposal review tab. Those first three guides previously shipped with no images at all.
