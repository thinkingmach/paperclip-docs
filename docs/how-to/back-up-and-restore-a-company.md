# Back up and restore a company

Backups are exports. Restores are imports. Both flow through the same portable markdown package — the same files you'd hand to a teammate or version-control. This recipe walks the API path: preview → export → import → verify, with the safety rails that the CEO-scoped routes enforce.

The same pair also moves a company from one instance to another: export on the old host, import on the new one. That is now the supported migration path, since host-to-host Cloud Sync has been retired.

The CLI shortcut (`thinkingmach company export | import`) is fine for one-off work — see [Export & Import](../guides/power/export-import.md). The HTTP routes below are what you'll wire into a routine, a CI job, or any agent that needs durable backups.

---

## What a package contains

A bundle is a tree of markdown files plus a `.paperclip.yaml` sidecar and a content-addressed blob store:

```text
my-company/
├── README.md
├── COMPANY.md
├── agents/
│   └── ceo/AGENTS.md
├── projects/
│   └── main/PROJECT.md
├── skills/
│   └── review/SKILL.md
├── tasks/
│   └── 2026-04-27-onboarding/
│       ├── TASK.md
│       └── documents/brief.md
├── images/
├── blobs/
└── .paperclip.yaml
```

The `include` flags decide which slices ride along:

| Flag | Default | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `company` | `true` | `COMPANY.md` + branding, logo, budget, hiring policy |
| `agents` | `true` | `agents/<slug>/AGENTS.md` + adapter type, runtime config, permissions, budgets, env-var declarations |
| `projects` | `false` | `projects/<slug>/PROJECT.md` + workspace config |
| `skills` | `false` | `skills/<key>/SKILL.md` (referenced or vendored) |
| `issues` | `false` | `tasks/<slug>/TASK.md` and routines, with comments, labels, blockers, documents, work products, monitors, and attachments (use sparingly — bundles get large) |

In addition to the include flags, you can scope by id with `agents`, `skills`, `projects`, `issues`, and `projectIssues` arrays. Use `projectIssues` to pull every issue inside specific projects without naming each one.

Attachment bytes never sit inline in a markdown file. They live in `blobs/`, named by the SHA-256 of their contents, and each task's manifest entry points at the blob it needs. That's what makes the bundle self-verifying on the way back in.

**Never in the bundle.** Secret values, API keys, machine paths, database ids. Anything environment-specific. The package declares the env vars an agent needs; the values stay on the source machine.

**Deliberately left behind.** Approvals, cost events, and activity log entries. These describe what happened on the source instance rather than how the company is set up, so they don't travel. The next section shows you how to find out, before you export, whether your company has any.

---

## 0. Check what the bundle won't carry

Ask the fidelity route what will be left behind:

```bash
curl "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/export/fidelity" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THINKINGMACH_API_KEY"
```

The response counts the records in each category the bundle handles, and returns a `warnings` array — one entry per category that has rows but can't be exported:

```json
{
  "schema": "paperclip-export-fidelity-v1",
  "companyId": "…",
  "counts": { "issueDocuments": 14, "issueAttachments": 6, "approvals": 3, "costEvents": 812, "activityLogEntries": 4210, "…": 0 },
  "warnings": [
    { "code": "approvals_not_exported",       "severity": "warning", "message": "3 approvals are not included in the export bundle." },
    { "code": "cost_history_not_exported",    "severity": "warning", "message": "812 cost events are not included in the export bundle." },
    { "code": "activity_history_not_exported","severity": "warning", "message": "4210 activity log entries are not included in the export bundle." }
  ],
  "generatedAt": "2026-08-01T02:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Warnings are informational — none of them stop an export. Log them alongside the bundle so a future restore knows exactly what it isn't getting. The UI shows the same list as a **Not included in this export** panel.

> **Who can call it.** Same rule as the export routes: the CEO agent of the route company, or a board caller with company access.

---

## 1. Preview an export

Always preview before you keep a bundle. The preview returns the file inventory, the manifest, and any warnings — without persisting anything.

```bash
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/exports/preview" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THINKINGMACH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "include": { "company": true, "agents": true, "projects": true, "issues": false }
  }'
```

The response (`CompanyPortabilityExportPreviewResult`) shape:

```json
{
  "rootPath": "my-company",
  "counts": { "files": 12, "agents": 3, "skills": 2, "projects": 1, "issues": 0 },
  "fileInventory": [
    { "path": "COMPANY.md",             "kind": "company" },
    { "path": "README.md",              "kind": "readme" },
    { "path": "agents/ceo/AGENTS.md",   "kind": "agent" },
    { "path": "projects/main/PROJECT.md", "kind": "project" }
  ],
  "manifest": { "schemaVersion": 6, "...": "..." },
  "files": { "COMPANY.md": "name: ...\n" },
  "warnings": []
}
```

Paths are relative to `rootPath`, not prefixed with it — `rootPath` is only the folder name the package unpacks into.

`fileInventory` is the inventory you skim before keeping anything. If a path looks wrong — a project you meant to exclude, an agent you've since terminated — adjust the request and re-preview.

> **Who can call it.** The CEO agent of the route company, or a board caller with company access. Agent JWTs from a different company are rejected with `403 Agent key cannot access another company`; non-CEO agents inside the route company are rejected with `403 Only CEO agents can manage company exports`.

---

## 2. Build the export (with `selectedFiles`)

Once the inventory looks right, post the same body to the build route:

```bash
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/exports" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THINKINGMACH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "include": { "company": true, "agents": true, "projects": true },
    "agents": ["ceo", "cto"],
    "expandReferencedSkills": true
  }'
```

To narrow further — say, drop a noisy project's `PROJECT.md` from a backup that otherwise covers everything — pass an explicit `selectedFiles` array of paths drawn from the preview's `fileInventory`:

```json
{
  "include": { "company": true, "agents": true, "projects": true },
  "selectedFiles": [
    "COMPANY.md",
    "agents/ceo/AGENTS.md",
    "agents/cto/AGENTS.md",
    "projects/main/PROJECT.md"
  ]
}
```

Anything not listed is dropped from the resulting `files` object. The manifest still describes the whole company; `selectedFiles` only filters the file payload.

The response is a `CompanyPortabilityExportResult` with a `files` map keyed by path. Persist it however your backup target wants it — write each entry to disk, ship the JSON to S3, commit it to a private Git repo. The bundle is text, so diffs and audits are cheap.

---

## 3. Restore to a new company

To rebuild a company from scratch (true disaster-recovery), use the **board** import routes. They accept any `target.mode`, including `new_company`:

```bash
# Preview the restore plan
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/import/preview" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @- <<'JSON'
{
  "source": {
    "type": "inline",
    "rootPath": "my-company",
    "files": { "...": "..." },
    "expectedFileCount": 12
  },
  "target": { "mode": "new_company", "newCompanyName": "Horizon Labs (restored)" },
  "include": { "company": true, "agents": true, "projects": true },
  "collisionStrategy": "rename"
}
JSON
```

`expectedFileCount` is optional but worth sending: it is your assertion of how many files you put in the body, and the server refuses the import if fewer arrive. See [The two integrity guards](#the-two-integrity-guards) below.

The preview returns a `CompanyPortabilityPreviewResult` with the agent, project, and issue plans (`create` / `update` / `skip`) plus any required env inputs. Read it carefully — this is the contract for what the apply step will do.

When the plan looks right, apply it:

```bash
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/import" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @import-request.json
```

The response includes the new `company.id` and per-entity `created` / `updated` / `skipped` actions. **Imported agents always start with timer heartbeats off** — set budgets, fill in env vars, then turn heartbeats back on when you're ready.

Add `"pauseAutomations": true` to the request body if you also want the imported agents and routines to land paused. That's a separate switch from the heartbeat default: heartbeats-off stops them waking on a timer, `pauseAutomations` stops them running at all until you unpause each one. The UI ticks it by default; the CLI leaves it off.

> **Why this is instance-admin only.** Creating a new company is an instance-level action: it allocates a tenant, an issue prefix, and a budget policy. This route requires board access with instance-admin rights. Agents can't do that, even CEOs. The CEO-safe routes in the next section handle imports into the route company only.

### Restoring a large bundle

A full-fidelity bundle for a busy company gets big, and a single inline JSON body is the fragile way to ship it. Two mechanisms exist for that case, and both are worth wiring into any restore you expect to run under pressure.

**Upload the zip instead of inline JSON.** `POST /api/companies/import` (and its `/preview` sibling) also accept the compressed package directly — as `multipart/form-data` with the archive in a `package` file field and the rest of the import request as a JSON `meta` field, or as a bare `application/zip` body with `meta` in the query string. The server unzips it into exactly the same `{ rootPath, files }` bundle an inline source carries, so import semantics are identical either way. The compressed upload is roughly a third the size and survives proxies that would truncate the inflated JSON.

```bash
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/import?async=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOARD_TOKEN" \
  -F "package=@my-company.zip" \
  -F 'meta={"target":{"mode":"new_company","newCompanyName":"Horizon Labs (restored)"},"collisionStrategy":"rename"}'
```

**Run it as a background job.** Add `?async=1` and the route answers `202` immediately with a job id and a `statusUrl` instead of holding the connection open:

```json
{ "job": { "id": "…", "status": "running" }, "statusUrl": "/api/companies/import/jobs/…", "retryAfterMs": 1000 }
```

Poll that URL until `job.status` is `succeeded` or `failed`; a successful board job carries the full import result under `job.importResult`. A job is readable only by the identity that created it, and lives in memory — a server restart, an unknown id, or someone else's id all return the same `404`. Only one import runs per account at a time: resubmitting the *same* request while it's still running returns `409` pointing at the job already in flight so you can adopt it, and a *different* import returns `409` with no job attached.

### The two integrity guards

Restores fail closed rather than half-writing a company.

1. **Truncation.** An inline source may declare `expectedFileCount` — the number of files the client believes it sent. If fewer arrive, the import is rejected with `import_payload_incomplete` and the expected/received counts, so a cut-off upload can never import a fragment. More files than declared is not a truncation symptom and is allowed; omitting the field keeps older callers working.
2. **Tampering or corruption.** Before a single row is written, every `blobs/<sha256>` entry is hashed and compared against the name it's filed under. A mismatch aborts the whole import naming the offending file.

---

## 4. Import into the same company

For non-destructive merges into the **same** company — re-importing your own backup, applying a refresh from a versioned bundle — use the CEO-safe routes:

```bash
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/imports/preview" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THINKINGMACH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "source": { "type": "inline", "rootPath": "my-company", "files": { "...": "..." } },
    "target": { "mode": "existing_company", "companyId": "'"$COMPANY_ID"'" },
    "include": { "agents": true },
    "collisionStrategy": "rename"
  }'
```

These routes enforce two rules at the gate:

1. `target.companyId` must equal the route company. Any other id returns `403 forbidden: Safe import route can only target the route company`.
2. `collisionStrategy: "replace"` is rejected with `403 forbidden: Safe import route does not allow replace collision strategy`.

The collision strategies that *do* work:

| Strategy | What happens on a name conflict |
|---|---|
| `rename` (default) | Append a suffix — `ceo` becomes `ceo-2`. Always safe. |
| `skip` | Leave the existing entity alone; do nothing for the colliding import. |

Apply the plan with the preview body sent to the apply route:

```bash
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/imports/apply" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THINKINGMACH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @import-request.json
```

---

## 5. Why `replace` is rejected on safe routes

`replace` overwrites existing agents, projects, and skills with the bundle's contents. Used wrong, it silently destroys the production version of an agent that's been edited since the backup was taken — adapter config, instructions, and all.

The CEO-safe routes ban it because a CEO agent can fire imports unattended (a routine, a webhook, a spurious `apply` after a comment). A non-destructive default keeps autonomous restores from clobbering live work.

If you genuinely need `replace` semantics — say, you're forcibly snapping production back to a known-good bundle — go through the board route at `POST /api/companies/import` with a board token. That path is explicit, audited, and gated by a human session.

---

## 6. Nightly export routine

Schedule a daily export so a fresh bundle exists when you need one. Create a routine that wakes a backup-owner agent — a small CEO-role agent dedicated to running the export and writing the bundle to wherever your backups live (object storage, a Git repo, a cron-mounted volume).

```bash
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/companies/$COMPANY_ID/routines" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THINKINGMACH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Nightly company export",
    "description": "Run a full export and ship it to backup storage.",
    "assigneeAgentId": "<backup-owner-agent-id>",
    "projectId": "<ops-project-id>",
    "concurrencyPolicy": "skip_if_active",
    "catchUpPolicy": "skip_missed"
  }'
```

Then attach a schedule trigger:

```bash
curl -X POST "$THINKINGMACH_API_URL/api/routines/<routine-id>/triggers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $THINKINGMACH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "kind": "schedule",
    "label": "Daily 02:00 UTC",
    "enabled": true,
    "cronExpression": "0 2 * * *",
    "timezone": "UTC"
  }'
```

The agent's heartbeat handler does three things on each run: `POST /exports/preview` to inventory, `POST /exports` to build, then upload the resulting `files` payload to your backup target. Pin retention in the agent's instructions — e.g. "keep 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly". A dedicated routine recipe is coming as HT6; until then, [Heartbeats & Routines](../guides/projects-workflow/routines.md) covers the routine model end-to-end.

---

## 7. Round-trip verification

After the first restore, sanity-check it:

1. **Counts.** Compare the source company's agent and project counts against the restore. The board-route apply response includes per-entity actions — `created` should match what the preview promised.
2. **Adapter config.** Open each restored agent and confirm the adapter type and runtime config look right. Env-var values won't be present (by design); fill them in before enabling heartbeats.
3. **First heartbeat.** Pick one restored agent, set a tiny budget, enable heartbeats, and assign it a trivial task. If it wakes, checks out, and comments, the restore is healthy.

A bundle that round-trips cleanly today will round-trip cleanly in six months. A bundle nobody has ever restored is only a backup in name.

---

## 8. Migrating to another instance

Moving a company to a different host — laptop to server, self-hosted to ThinkingMach Cloud, or back again — is the same two steps with the second one pointed somewhere else:

1. Export on the source instance (sections 1 and 2), with `include` covering everything you want to keep: `company`, `agents`, `projects`, `skills`, and `issues`.
2. Import on the target instance with a board token and `target.mode: "new_company"` (section 3), using the zip upload and `?async=1` if the bundle is large.

Then finish the restore checklist: env-var values, budgets, adapters, and finally heartbeats. Nothing connects the two instances to each other — the package is the only thing that travels, which is what makes it safe to move it through a Git repo, object storage, or a USB stick.

This replaces the retired host-to-host Cloud Sync. If you have scripts pointed at `cloud connect` or `cloud push`, port them to `POST /api/companies/{id}/export` plus `POST /api/companies/import`, or to `thinkingmach company export` and `thinkingmach company import`.
