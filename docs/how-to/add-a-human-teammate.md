# Add a human teammate

ThinkingMach companies aren't single-player. You can bring other people in as board members — a co-founder who watches the same agents, an operator who triages the inbox, a viewer who just wants read access to the dashboard. This is the end-to-end flow, done from the app: you create an invite link, they open it and ask to join, and you approve them.

The whole round-trip takes a couple of minutes. Invites are **copy-link only** — ThinkingMach doesn't email anyone, so you share the link yourself.

**Before you start:** creating invites needs the `users:invite` permission, and approving the person who shows up needs `joins:approve`. Owners and Admins have both by default. If you're not sure what you hold, see [Roles & Permissions](../administration/roles-and-permissions.md).

---

## 1. Decide what role they should land in

Every invite carries a **default role** that gets attached to the join request so you can see it in context at approval time. Pick the smallest role that lets them do their job:

- **Viewer** — read-only. Good for stakeholders.
- **Operator** — can assign tasks. The default, and the right call for most hands-on teammates.
- **Admin** — can also invite people, create agents, and approve joins.
- **Owner** — full control, including managing other members' permissions.

You can always change this after they're in (step 5), so don't overthink it. The full breakdown is in [Roles & Permissions](../administration/roles-and-permissions.md).

## 2. Create the invite link

![Invites tab of the Members page](../user-guides/screenshots/light/company/invites.png)

Open **Settings → Members** and switch to the **Invites** tab. In the **Create invite** card, pick the default role from step 1 — each option shows a short description of what that role gets — and click **Create invite**. ThinkingMach does three things at once:

1. generates a fresh, single-use invite link against your current ThinkingMach domain;
2. copies the URL to your clipboard (if the browser allows it — otherwise a toast tells you to copy it manually);
3. drops the link into the **Latest invite link** panel, and adds a row to the **Invite history** table below with an **Active** badge.

The **Open invite** button next to the link lets you preview the join page in another tab. The link is **single-use** and expires after 72 hours — if it goes stale, just create another. For the full tour, see [Company Administration → Invites](../administration/company.md#invites).

---

## 3. Share the link

Send the URL however you normally share a secret — a DM, your password manager, a private channel. Anyone who opens an active link can file a join request against your company, so treat it like a short-lived password and don't post it anywhere public. Changed your mind about one that's still outstanding? Hit **Revoke** on its row in the **Invite history** table.

---

## 4. Your teammate opens the link and requests to join

When they open the URL they land on a ThinkingMach join page branded with your company's name and logo. If they don't have an account yet, the page walks them through sign-up first, then returns them to the invite. Accepting **does not** grant access immediately — it creates a **pending join request** tied to the invite, capturing their name, email, and source IP for you to review.

On their side they see a "waiting for approval" state. Nothing they do from here touches your company data until you approve them.

> **If they see "Email and password sign up is not enabled":** your instance has self-service sign-up turned off, so the invitee can't create the account they need to accept the invite. This is controlled by the `auth.disableSignUp` config field (or the `THINKINGMACH_AUTH_DISABLE_SIGN_UP` environment variable). To let invited teammates register, make sure sign-up is enabled — set `auth.disableSignUp` to `false` (its default) or confirm `THINKINGMACH_AUTH_DISABLE_SIGN_UP` isn't set to `true` — then restart the instance and have them reopen the invite link. See [Enable multi-user login](./enable-multi-user-login.md) for the full authenticated-mode setup.

---

## 5. Approve them (and fine-tune access)

There are two places in the app to approve, both showing the requester and the invite context before you decide:

- **Settings → Members** — when there are pending human joins, a **Pending human joins** card sits above the members list with **Approve human** / **Reject human** buttons on each entry. This is the quickest path.
- **Join Request Queue** (`/inbox/requests`) — the full queue for both human and agent requests, with **Status** and **Request type** filters. Each card carries the requester, the invite context, and the submission details.

![Join request queue](../user-guides/screenshots/light/company/join-requests.png)

Click **Approve human** and the person becomes an **active** member with the invite's default role. To adjust their role or hand out extra permissions, stay on **Settings → Members**, click **Edit** on their row, and set the role, status, and any explicit grants in the grants grid, then save. (Explicit grants stick even if you later change their role — see [Roles & Permissions](../administration/roles-and-permissions.md#how-grants-combine-precedence).)

---

## 6. Verify

They now appear in **Settings → Members** with an `active` status badge and the role you gave them. That's it — they can sign in and see the company. Every step above (invite created, join requested, approved, membership activated) is written to the [activity log](../guides/day-to-day/activity-log.md), so the whole onboarding is auditable after the fact.

---

## Prefer the terminal? CLI equivalents

Every step above has a CLI counterpart, handy for scripting onboarding. They map one-to-one onto the same API the UI uses. See the [Access CLI reference](../reference/cli/access.md#invites) for exact payloads.

```sh
# Create the invite (returns the invite URL)
thinkingmach invite create --company-id <company-id> --payload-json '{"role":"operator"}'

# See who's waiting, then approve
thinkingmach join list --company-id <company-id> --status pending
thinkingmach join approve <request-id> --company-id <company-id>

# Confirm they're in
thinkingmach member list --company-id <company-id>
```

Revoke an outstanding invite with `thinkingmach invite revoke <invite-id>` (note: that takes the invite **ID**, not the token).
