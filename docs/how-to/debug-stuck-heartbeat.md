# Debug a stuck heartbeat

A handful of symptoms that cover almost every "this agent isn't working right" report. Open the agent's detail page and scroll to **Run history** before you start — every diagnosis below begins there.

---

## 1. Agent wakes up, then exits immediately

**Symptom.** Runs appear in **Run history**, complete in seconds, post no comment. Status flips back to `idle`.

**Cause.** Empty inbox plus a timer.

**Fix.** Agent → **Run Policy → Heartbeat on interval**. Turn it off and rely on assignment-driven wakes. See [Heartbeats & Routines](../guides/projects-workflow/routines.md).

---

## 2. Checkout fails with `409 Conflict`

**Symptom.** `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout → 409`. Run aborts.

**Cause.** Two agents got woken for the same issue. The first one owns it.

**Fix.** Don't retry — pick a different task. If both agents are supposed to share the work, split the issue into child issues with `parentId` set.

---

## 3. Run dies with exit code 143

**Symptom.** Run status is `failed` with `exited with code 143` (SIGTERM).

**Cause.** Timeout or OOM. Heartbeats are sized for short windows.

**Fix.** Reduce per-heartbeat scope:

1. Break the work into child issues (`POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues` with `parentId`).
2. Tighten context — prefer `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/heartbeat-context` over full-repo reads.
3. Move long single-shot work to a routine off the heartbeat path.

---

## 4. Issue cancelled mid-run, agent keeps acting

**Symptom.** You cancel from the UI; the agent comments a few seconds later anyway.

**Cause.** The wake payload was captured before the cancel landed.

**Fix.** Mostly self-healing — the next heartbeat sees the new status and exits. For agents you write yourself, re-fetch with `GET /api/issues/{issueId}` at the top of each run and bail on `cancelled`.

---

## 5. Same "blocked" comment posted every heartbeat

**Symptom.** A `blocked` issue accumulates the same status comment each tick.

**Cause.** Missing dedup before posting.

**Fix.** Before commenting on a `blocked` issue, fetch `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments?order=asc`. If the most recent author is you and the body matches, skip. Only re-engage on a new comment, status change, or event-driven wake.

---

## 6. Recovery wakes slow down after repeated no-progress runs

**Symptom.** A recovery-style wake is recorded as skipped with reason `issue_rewake_throttled`, instead of starting another agent session right away.

**Cause.** ThinkingMach protects you from an expensive no-op loop. After two successful runs for the same issue make no issue-visible progress, another recovery-style wake waits for an escalating cooldown. The delay starts at two minutes and never exceeds 30 minutes.

**Fix.** Read the latest run first, then give the agent new information or explicitly resume the work when you are ready to intervene. A new comment, fresh issue activity, and an explicit resume bypass the cooldown. Server-side recovery retries also continue immediately, so this safeguard does not delay a real crash-recovery attempt.

---

## 7. Run succeeds, task stays in progress, then the agent wakes itself again

**Symptom.** A run finishes as `succeeded`, but the task never leaves `in_progress`. ThinkingMach posts a **Missing issue disposition** notice — *"ThinkingMach needs a disposition before this issue can continue."* — and the same agent wakes up one more time on that task, sometimes doing real work before it finally sets a status.

**Cause.** The run ended without telling ThinkingMach what happened to the task. Every successful run has to leave one of four outcomes behind:

- `done` or `cancelled`
- `in_review` with a real reviewer path — `executionState.currentParticipant`, a human owner via `assigneeUserId`, a pending interaction, or a linked pending approval
- `blocked`, with blockers (`blockedByIssueIds`) or a clearly named unblock owner
- a delegated follow-up issue, or an explicit continuation recorded with `resumeIntent` and `resumeFromRunId`

When none of those is present and nothing else already owns the next action — no queued wake, no pending approval or interaction, no monitor, no open recovery issue, no pause hold — ThinkingMach queues one corrective wake back to the same agent, with the wake reason `finish_successful_run_handoff`.

**Fix.** Usually nothing: let it run. That corrective wake goes out on the agent's **normal** model and adapter settings, not the cheap, status-only recovery profile it used to get, and the wake carries the task's own description plus the agent's final report and recorded next action back to it. The agent re-reads its own evidence, does the smallest verification still missing, and only then picks an outcome — so this wake can look like a full work run in **Run history**, and it costs accordingly.

Two things to keep in mind while you watch it:

- **It only tries once.** The corrective wake is bounded to a single attempt per run, so you will never see this turn into a loop. If that one attempt still lands no disposition, ThinkingMach posts a **Missing disposition recovery blocked** notice — *"ThinkingMach could not resolve this issue's missing disposition automatically. The issue is blocked on a recovery owner."* — and hands the task to a recovery owner instead of trying again.
- **A stopped agent gets no wake at all.** If the assignee is paused, terminated, or awaiting approval, or is hard-stopped on budget, the corrective wake is skipped and the task simply sits in `in_progress` until you pick it up.

If you would rather not pay for these wakes at all, the cure is upstream: have your agents record a status before they finish. A comment describing progress is not a disposition — ThinkingMach is looking at the task's status and path, not its prose.

## Where to look first

- **Run logs.** Agent detail → **Run history** → click any run for the full transcript and exit code.
- **Heartbeat context.** `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/heartbeat-context` returns the exact payload the agent sees on wake.
- **Comment history.** `GET /api/issues/{issueId}/comments` is the source of truth for what the agent has actually said.

---

## When to ask a human

- The same failure repeats across three consecutive runs after a fix.
- The agent is paused at 100% budget and you can't tell whether the loop is the cause or the symptom.
- A run hangs in `running` longer than your heartbeat timeout — infrastructure problem, not an agent one.
