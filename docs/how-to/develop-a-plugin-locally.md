# Develop a plugin locally

Build a ThinkingMach plugin from a folder on your laptop, install it into a running ThinkingMach instance straight from disk, and iterate with the worker reloading after every save. End-to-end on a fresh checkout in about 15 minutes — most of that is the first `pnpm install`.

The mental model is unchanged from a normal install: ThinkingMach is the control plane, and a plugin is a self-contained package that ships its own worker, manifest, and (optionally) UI. The only thing the local-development loop adds is that ThinkingMach reads that package from a path on your machine instead of from an npm registry, and it watches the package's `dist/` output so you do not have to reinstall after every code change.

> **For everyone, not just developers.** If you want to *use* a plugin somebody else has shipped, see [Administration → Plugins](../administration/plugins.md) instead. This page is for the moment you want to write or fork one.

## What "local-path install" actually means

When you run `thinkingmach plugin install <path>`, the CLI does two things differently from a `thinkingmach plugin install @scope/name` install:

1. It auto-detects that the argument is a local filesystem path (anything starting with `/`, `./`, `../`, `~`, or an existing folder relative to your current directory) and resolves it to an absolute path before sending it to the server.
2. It sets `isLocalPath: true` on the request to `POST /api/plugins/install`, which tells ThinkingMach to read the package from disk rather than fetching it from npm.

You can force the local path interpretation with `--local` if you'd rather be explicit. The CLI rejects `--version` for local-path installs — version pinning only applies to npm packages.

On the server side, ThinkingMach canonicalizes the path before it loads anything from it: the value is resolved to an absolute path, then to its real path — `..` segments collapsed, symlinks followed — and it has to be a directory the server can read. A normal `thinkingmach plugin install ~/dev/my-plugin` is unaffected by this, and there's no restriction on *where* on your filesystem the folder lives. Two things are worth knowing anyway. A symlinked plugin folder installs as its real target, so that's the path ThinkingMach records and watches. And a path that isn't a readable directory fails immediately with `Invalid localPath: …` rather than turning into a confusing manifest error further down.

The one place local-path installs don't work at all is an instance managed by a ThinkingMach control plane rather than run by you — those only accept plugins bundled with the application. Develop against an instance you run yourself, which is what the rest of this guide assumes.

Local-path plugins run as trusted local code, under the same trust boundary as the rest of the running ThinkingMach instance. There is no sandboxing of worker code and no signature check beyond "ThinkingMach can read the path you gave it." Don't local-install a plugin you didn't write or audit.

---

## Prereqs

- Node.js 24 (24.11.0 or newer) and `pnpm`.
- A local ThinkingMach checkout you can run from source. Local plugin installs need the running ThinkingMach server to be able to read the path you point it at — that's almost always the same machine as your editor.
- The ThinkingMach CLI on your `PATH`. See [Installation](../guides/getting-started/installation.md) if you don't have it yet.

---

## 1. Start ThinkingMach

```bash
pnpm thinkingmach run
```

ThinkingMach listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3100` by default. The CLI talks to that server, so leave it running in its own terminal.

---

## 2. Scaffold the plugin

```bash
thinkingmach plugin init @acme/hello-plugin --output ~/dev/paperclip-plugins
```

`plugin init` creates a folder named after the package (minus the npm scope) under `--output`. So `@acme/hello-plugin` with `--output ~/dev/paperclip-plugins` lands at `~/dev/paperclip-plugins/hello-plugin/`. Inside you get a `src/manifest.ts`, a `src/worker.ts`, a starter `src/ui/index.tsx`, an esbuild watch config, a Vitest config, and a snapshot of `@thinkingmach/plugin-sdk` from your ThinkingMach checkout so the package builds without ever publishing to npm.

The flags that matter on a first scaffold:

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--output <dir>` | Parent directory to create the plugin folder in. Default is the current directory. |
| `--template <default\|connector\|workspace\|environment>` | Starter shape. `default` is a good first plugin; `connector` adds outbound-integration scaffolding; `workspace` adds project-scoped surfaces; `environment` scaffolds an environment-driver plugin. |
| `--category <connector\|workspace\|automation\|ui\|environment>` | Manifest category — the chip that shows up on the Plugin Manager page. |
| `--display-name <name>` | Manifest display name. |
| `--description <description>` | Manifest description. |
| `--author <author>` | Manifest author. |
| `--sdk-path <path>` | Absolute path to a specific `packages/plugins/sdk` checkout. Useful if you have more than one ThinkingMach clone. |

When `plugin init` finishes, it prints the next four commands verbatim. You can copy them straight from the terminal — they are the same ones in the next two steps.

---

## 3. Install dependencies and run the watch build

```bash
cd ~/dev/paperclip-plugins/hello-plugin
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` runs `esbuild --watch` against the plugin source and emits the built outputs into `dist/`: `dist/manifest.js`, `dist/worker.js`, and `dist/ui/`. Leave it running. Every time you save a `.ts` or `.tsx` file under `src/`, esbuild rewrites the matching output file.

If you're iterating on the UI and want hot module replacement in the browser, run `pnpm dev:ui` in a second terminal. It serves `dist/ui/` on `http://127.0.0.1:4177`. That's optional — ThinkingMach can read the built UI directly from `dist/ui/` without the dev server.

---

## 4. Install from the absolute path

In a third terminal (ThinkingMach in the first, `pnpm dev` in the second), point the CLI at the plugin folder:

```bash
thinkingmach plugin install ~/dev/paperclip-plugins/hello-plugin
```

You'll see something like:

```
Installing plugin from local path: /Users/you/dev/paperclip-plugins/hello-plugin
✓ Installed acme.hello-plugin v0.1.0 (ready)
Local plugin installs run trusted local code from your machine.
Keep `pnpm dev` running in /Users/you/dev/paperclip-plugins/hello-plugin; ThinkingMach watches rebuilt dist output and reloads the plugin worker.
```

The hint at the bottom is the part to internalise. ThinkingMach will keep watching the package's `dist/` directory; you just need to keep your watch build feeding it.

Relative paths work too — `thinkingmach plugin install .` from inside the plugin folder is the same install. If you prefer to be explicit, `--local` forces the local-path interpretation regardless of the argument shape.

---

## 5. Confirm and dashboard check

```bash
thinkingmach plugin list
thinkingmach plugin inspect acme.hello-plugin
```

`list` prints one line per installed plugin with `key=`, `status=`, `version=`, and the database `id=`. `inspect` adds the full last error if one is recorded. Both accept `--json` for scripting.

Open the Plugin Manager in the browser at **Settings → Plugins** and you'll see the same plugin in the installed list, with whatever capabilities the manifest declared shown in the Permissions sidebar. The detail page's Status tab is where the worker process, recent job runs, and rolling logs surface — leave it open in a tab while you iterate.

---

## The reload loop

This is the part that makes local development pleasant. ThinkingMach watches the runtime entrypoints declared in the package's `paperclipPlugin` field — by default `dist/manifest.js`, `dist/worker.js`, and `dist/ui/`. When a file changes, the watcher debounces briefly and acts:

- **Worker code.** Save a `.ts` file under `src/` → esbuild rewrites `dist/worker.js` → ThinkingMach restarts the plugin worker. The next worker call uses the new code. There is no in-process hot reload for worker code — it's a clean restart.
- **Manifest.** Save `src/manifest.ts` → `dist/manifest.js` rewrites → the worker restarts and the host re-reads the manifest.
- **Plugin UI.** Save a `.tsx` file → esbuild rewrites `dist/ui/` → ThinkingMach reloads the UI bundle on its next mount. For HMR during UI work, run `pnpm dev:ui` and point `devUiUrl` in your manifest at `http://127.0.0.1:4177` while developing.
- **No watch build, no reload.** The watcher only fires on `dist/*` changes. If `pnpm dev` is stopped, source edits never reach ThinkingMach — restart `pnpm dev` (or run `pnpm build` once) before expecting changes.

`node_modules`, `.git`, `.paperclip-sdk`, and other dotfolders are ignored by the watcher. Adding a new dependency requires actually importing it from your code and letting the watch build rebuild before the worker sees it.

The ThinkingMach server never compiles plugin source for you. Your package's own build scripts own that step.

---

## Cleaning up between iterations

A few CLI commands you'll reach for once you're cycling:

```bash
thinkingmach plugin disable acme.hello-plugin    # pause without uninstalling
thinkingmach plugin enable acme.hello-plugin     # bring it back
thinkingmach plugin uninstall acme.hello-plugin  # remove the install record
thinkingmach plugin uninstall acme.hello-plugin --force  # also purge state and config
```

`disable` is the right move when you want to stop the worker temporarily — config and any data the plugin has stored are preserved. `uninstall` removes the install record but keeps stored state by default; `--force` purges everything so the next install starts from scratch.

To browse the bundled example plugins (handy when you want to crib a manifest shape or surface contribution), run:

```bash
thinkingmach plugin examples
```

Each row includes a ready-to-run `thinkingmach plugin install <path>` line.

## When to switch to an npm install

Local-path installs and npm installs hit the same endpoint, but they mean different things:

- **Local paths** are trusted local code from a checkout you control. Good for developing or operating against your own clone. No signature check, no provenance metadata beyond the path.
- **npm packages** are the deployable artifact. `thinkingmach plugin install @acme/plugin-hello` (with `--version` if you want to pin) installs from your configured registry, produces an install record other operators can reproduce, and is the form to ship.

When you're done iterating, publish the package and reinstall from the npm form so the install reflects what you'll actually deploy.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Install returns `error` status.** Run `thinkingmach plugin inspect <key>` for the last error. The three usual suspects: (1) the plugin hasn't been built yet — run `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build` first; (2) the `paperclipPlugin` entries in `package.json` point at files that don't exist on disk; (3) the manifest failed validation. The ThinkingMach server log has the full validation error.

**Install fails with `Invalid localPath: …`.** The server couldn't turn your argument into a readable directory. `path does not exist` means the resolved path is wrong — check the spelling. (The CLI always sends an absolute path. If you're calling `POST /api/plugins/install` directly instead, a relative path is resolved against the server process's own working directory.) `path is not a directory` means you pointed at a file instead of the package folder. `path is not readable` means the folder is there but the ThinkingMach server process doesn't have permission to read it.

**Edits don't seem to reload.** Confirm `pnpm dev` is still running and writing to `dist/`. If you renamed entry files, update `paperclipPlugin.manifest`, `paperclipPlugin.worker`, or `paperclipPlugin.ui` in `package.json` so the watcher targets them.

**Worker restarts but the UI is stale.** Hard-reload the page. For HMR during UI iteration, run `pnpm dev:ui` and set `devUiUrl` in your manifest to `http://127.0.0.1:4177`.

**Path arguments fail on Windows.** Quote paths that contain spaces, and prefer absolute paths over `~`-prefixed paths in non-bash shells.

**`--version is only supported for npm package installs`.** You passed both a local path and `--version`. Drop `--version` — version pinning only applies to npm packages.

For deeper diagnosis of a plugin worker that crashes on start or fails its health check, the Status tab on the plugin's detail page is the best first stop — worker state, recent runs, and the rolling log usually point at the cause faster than poking at the CLI.
