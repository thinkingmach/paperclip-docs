/**
 * Apply the catalog copy contract to every connector page.
 *
 * The connector pages were generated from the App manifest, so 20 of them led
 * with the manifest's placeholder line ("Connect Airtable's provider-hosted
 * MCP server.") and all of them described their setup with a vocabulary that
 * did not match the hub. This script is the source of truth for the parts that
 * have to agree with docs/connectors.md:
 *
 *   - the page lede and seo_description, which say what the service is and
 *     what ThinkingMach supports doing with it;
 *   - the Category row, using the hub's group names;
 *   - the connection-method name, using the hub's six names rather than a
 *     separate per-page sign-in vocabulary.
 *
 * It is idempotent: every replacement matches either the generated text or the
 * text this script writes. Re-run it after regenerating pages from a newer
 * App snapshot.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/sync/apply-connector-copy.mjs [--check]
